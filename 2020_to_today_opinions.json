Argued November 30, 2021\u2014Decided June 15, 2022\nThe Medicare statute lays out a formula that the Department of Health\n  and Human Services must employ annually to set reimbursement\n  rates for certain outpatient prescription drugs provided by hospitals to\n  Medicare patients. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii). That formula af-\n  fords HHS two options. Option 1 applies if HHS has conducted a sur-\n  vey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs for each covered outpatient drug.\n  Under this option, the agency may set reimbursement rates based on\n  the hospitals\u2019 \u201caverage acquisition cost\u201d for each drug, and may \u201cvary\u201d\n  the reimbursement rates \u201cby hospital group.\u201d \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(I).\n  Absent a survey, option 2 applies, and HHS must set reimbursement\n  rates based on \u201cthe average price\u201d charged by manufacturers for the\n  drug     as    \u201ccalculated   and     adjusted    by   the    Secretary.\u201d\n  \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II). Option 2 does not authorize HHS to vary re-\n  imbursement rates for different hospital groups. From the time these\n  provisions took effect in 2006 until 2018, HHS did not conduct surveys\n  of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs, relied on option 2, set the reimburse-\n  ment rates at about 106 percent, and did not vary those rates by hos-\n  pital group. For 2018, HHS again did not conduct a survey. But this\n  time it issued a final rule establishing separate reimbursement rates\n  for hospitals that serve low-income or rural populations through the\n  340B program and all other hospitals. For 2019, HHS set reimburse-\n  ment rates the same way.\n     The American Hospital Association and other interested parties\n  challenged the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates in federal court.\n  In response, HHS first contended that various statutory provisions\n  precluded judicial review of those rates. The agency also argued that\n\f2             AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    it could vary the reimbursement rates by hospital group under its op-\n    tion 2 authority to \u201cadjust\u201d the price-based reimbursement rates. The\n    District Court rejected HHS\u2019s argument that the statute precluded ju-\n    dicial review, concluded that HHS had acted outside its statutory au-\n    thority, and remanded the case to HHS to consider an appropriate\n    remedy. The D. C. Circuit, however, reversed. The court ruled that\n    the statute did not preclude judicial review, and upheld HHS\u2019s reduced\n    reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals.\nHeld:\n    1. The statute does not preclude judicial review of HHS\u2019s reimburse-\n ment rates. Judicial review of final agency action is traditionally\n available unless \u201ca statute\u2019s language or structure\u201d precludes it, Mach\n Mining, LLC v. EEOC, 575 U. S. 480, 486, and this Court has long\n recognized a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d in its favor, Weyerhaeuser Co. v.\n United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U. S. ___, ___. Here, no\n provision in the Medicare statute precludes judicial review of the 2018\n and 2019 reimbursement rates. HHS cites two nearby provisions that\n preclude review of the general payment methodology that HHS em-\n ploys to set rates for other Medicare outpatient services. See\n \u00a7\u00a71395l(t)(12)(A), (C). But HHS sets rates for outpatient prescription\n drugs using a different payment methodology. HHS also argues that\n other statutory requirements would make allowing judicial review of\n the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates impractical. Regardless, such\n arguments cannot override the text of the statute and the traditional\n presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action. Pp.\n 7\u20139.\n    2. Absent a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs, HHS may not vary\n the reimbursement rates only for 340B hospitals; HHS\u2019s 2018 and\n 2019 reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals were therefore unlawful.\n The text and structure of the statute make this a straightforward case.\n Because HHS did not conduct a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs,\n HHS acted unlawfully by reducing the reimbursement rates for 340B\n hospitals. HHS maintains that even when it does not conduct a sur-\n vey, the agency still may \u201cadjus[t]\u201d the average price \u201cas necessary.\u201d\n \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II). But HHS\u2019s power to increase or decrease the\n price is distinct from its power to set different rates for different groups\n of hospitals. Moreover, HHS\u2019s interpretation would make little sense\n given the statute\u2019s overall structure. Under HHS\u2019s interpretation, the\n agency would never need to conduct a survey of acquisition costs if it\n could proceed under option 2 and then do everything under option 2\n that it could do under option 1. That not only would render irrelevant\n the survey prerequisite for varying reimbursement rates by hospital\n group, but also would render largely irrelevant the provision of the\n statute that precisely details the requirements for surveys of hospitals\u2019\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                    3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  acquisition costs. See \u00a71395l(t)(14)(D). Finally, HHS\u2019s argument that\n  Congress could not have intended for the agency to \u201coverpay\u201d 340B\n  hospitals for prescription drugs ignores the fact that Congress, when\n  enacting the statute, was well aware that 340B hospitals paid less for\n  covered prescription drugs. It may be that the reimbursement pay-\n  ments were intended to offset the considerable costs of providing\n  healthcare to the uninsured and underinsured in low-income and rural\n  communities.

XAVIER BECERRA,\n             SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND\n               HUMAN SERVICES, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n                                  [June 15, 2022]\n\n  JUSTICE KAVANAUGH delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Under the Medicare statute, the Department of Health\nand Human Services must reimburse hospitals for certain\noutpatient prescription drugs that the hospitals provide to\nMedicare patients. HHS\u2019s total reimbursements to hospi-\ntals for prescription drugs add up to tens of billions of dol-\nlars every year.\n  To set the reimbursement rates for the prescription\ndrugs, HHS has two options under the statute. First, if\nHHS has conducted a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs\nfor the drugs, HHS may set the reimbursement rates based\non the hospitals\u2019 average acquisition costs\u2014that is, the\namount that hospitals pay to acquire the prescription\ndrugs\u2014and may vary the reimbursement rates for different\ngroups of hospitals. Second and alternatively, if HHS has\nnot conducted such a survey, HHS must instead set the re-\nimbursement rates based on the average sales price\ncharged by manufacturers for the drugs (with certain ad-\njustments), and HHS may not vary the reimbursement\n\f2         AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrates for different groups of hospitals.\n   For 2018 and 2019, HHS did not conduct a survey of hos-\npitals\u2019 acquisition costs for outpatient prescription drugs.\nBut HHS nonetheless substantially reduced the reimburse-\nment rates for one group of hospitals\u2014Section 340B hospi-\ntals, which generally serve low-income or rural communi-\nties. For those 340B hospitals, this case has immense\neconomic consequences, about $1.6 billion annually.\n   The question is whether the statute affords HHS discre-\ntion to vary the reimbursement rates for that one group of\nhospitals when, as here, HHS has not conducted the re-\nquired survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. The answer is\nno. We therefore reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of\nAppeals for the D. C. Circuit.\n                             I\n                             A\n   In 2003, Congress passed and President George W. Bush\nsigned landmark legislation expanding Medicare to cover\nprescription drugs. See Medicare Prescription Drug, Im-\nprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003, 117 Stat. 2066,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71395. Under that 2003 law, HHS must annu-\nally set reimbursement rates for certain outpatient pre-\nscription drugs provided by hospitals. \u00a71395l(t)(14).\n   The Medicare statute meticulously lays out the formula\nthat HHS must employ to set those reimbursement rates.\nAs relevant here, the agency\u2019s reimbursement rate for each\ncovered outpatient prescription drug \u201cshall be equal\u201d to one\nof two measures:\n    \u201c(I) to the average acquisition cost for the drug for that\n    year (which, at the option of the Secretary, may vary by\n    hospital group (as defined by the Secretary based on\n    volume of covered OPD services or other relevant char-\n    acteristics)), as determined by the Secretary taking\n    into account the hospital acquisition cost survey data\n    under subparagraph (D); or\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)               3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201c(II) if hospital acquisition cost data are not available,\n    the average price for the drug in the year established\n    under section 1395u(o) of this title, section 1395w\u20133a\n    of this title, or section 1395w\u20133b of this title, as the case\n    may be, as calculated and adjusted by the Secretary as\n    necessary for purposes of this paragraph.\u201d\n    \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii) (emphasis added).\n   To simplify a bit: Congress afforded HHS two options to\nset the reimbursement rates for hospitals. Option 1 applies\nif the agency has conducted a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisi-\ntion costs\u2014that is, the amount that hospitals pay to acquire\nthe prescription drugs. If the agency has conducted a sur-\nvey and collected that data, HHS may set reimbursement\nrates based on the hospitals\u2019 \u201caverage acquisition cost\u201d for\neach drug.         See \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(I); see also\n\u00a71395l(t)(14)(D) (requirements for conducting surveys of\nhospitals\u2019 drug acquisition costs). Importantly for present\npurposes, if HHS has conducted a survey of hospitals\u2019 ac-\nquisition costs, option 1 authorizes HHS to vary those re-\nimbursement rates for different groups of hospitals.\n   Option 2 applies if HHS has not conducted a survey of\nhospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. In that circumstance, the\nagency must set reimbursement rates based on \u201cthe aver-\nage price\u201d charged by manufacturers for the drug, as \u201ccal-\nculated and adjusted by the Secretary as necessary for pur-\nposes of \u201d this statutory provision. \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II).\nThe statute in turn sets \u201cthe average price\u201d as 106 percent\nof the drug\u2019s average sales price. See ibid. (citing \u00a71395w\u2013\n3a). Critically, option 2 does not authorize HHS to vary re-\nimbursement rates for different groups of hospitals.\n   For more than a decade after those provisions took effect\nin 2006, HHS did not conduct a survey of hospitals\u2019 acqui-\nsition costs. Indeed, HHS has only once attempted to con-\nduct such a survey\u2014in 2020, after this litigation com-\nmenced. At oral argument in this Court, the Government\n\f4          AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained that HHS had not previously attempted to con-\nduct such surveys because the surveys are \u201cvery burden-\nsome on the study takers,\u201d are \u201cvery burdensome on the\nhospitals,\u201d and do not \u201cproduce results that are all that ac-\ncurate.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 41\u201342.\n   As a result, until 2018, HHS consistently relied on option\n2 and set reimbursement rates for each drug based on the\naverage-sales-price data provided by manufacturers. Every\nyear, HHS set the reimbursement rates at about 106 per-\ncent of each covered drug\u2019s average sales price, and HHS\nused the same reimbursement rates for all hospitals. In\nother words, until 2018, HHS never varied the reimburse-\nment rates by hospital group. See Medicare Program: Hos-\npital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory\nSurgical Center Payment Systems and Quality Reporting\nPrograms, 82 Fed. Reg. 52490, 52494\u201352495 (2017).\n   During its rulemaking for 2018, HHS proposed a change\nto reduce the reimbursement rates only for 340B hospitals.\nImportantly, HHS did not conduct a survey of hospital ac-\nquisition costs. As a policy matter, HHS said that its exist-\ning reimbursement rates resulted in what the agency\nviewed as overpayments to hospitals that serve low-income\nor rural populations through the federal 340B program.\nFederal law requires drug manufacturers to sell prescrip-\ntion drugs to those 340B hospitals at prices below those\npaid by other hospitals. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7256b(a)(1) (setting\na \u201cceiling price\u201d that manufacturers can charge to 340B hos-\npitals). Consistent with the Medicare statute, however,\nHHS historically had reimbursed 340B hospitals for cov-\nered outpatient prescription drugs at the same reimburse-\nment rates that were set for all other hospitals. For 2018,\nHHS said that the uniform reimbursement rates combined\nwith the discounted prices paid by 340B hospitals for pre-\nscription drugs meant that 340B hospitals were able to\n\u201cgenerate significant profits\u201d when they provided the pre-\nscription drugs to Medicare patients. 82 Fed. Reg. 52494.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   In response to HHS\u2019s proposed change, the 340B hospi-\ntals countered that, under the Medicare statute, HHS could\nnot single out 340B hospitals without conducting a survey\nof hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. With respect to HHS\u2019s policy\narguments, the 340B hospitals explained that the reim-\nbursement payments for prescription drugs helped those\nhospitals offset the considerable costs of providing\nhealthcare to the uninsured and underinsured in low-\nincome and rural communities. The 340B hospitals pointed\nout, moreover, that Congress had long been aware of the\nsituation. Indeed, the hospitals claimed that Members of\nCongress not only were aware, but actually intended for the\n340B program\u2019s drug reimbursements to subsidize other\nservices provided by 340B hospitals. The hospitals noted\nthat Congress had never singled out 340B hospitals for\nlower Medicare reimbursements for outpatient prescription\ndrugs. Nor, until 2018, had HHS ever done so. Further-\nmore, the 340B hospitals asserted that reducing their reim-\nbursement rates for prescription drugs would force those\nhospitals to eliminate or dramatically curtail other crucial\nprograms that provide a wide range of medical services in\nlow-income and rural communities\u2014such as treatments for\ncancer, mental health issues, opioid addiction, and diabe-\ntes.\n   In the final rule for 2018, HHS decided to establish two\nseparate reimbursement rates: one rate for non-340B hos-\npitals and another rate for 340B hospitals. The reimburse-\nment rate for non-340B hospitals remained at the historical\nrate of approximately 106 percent of the average sales price\nfor each drug. But HHS established a substantially re-\nduced rate for 340B hospitals\u2014a rate equal to 77.5 percent\nof the average sales price for each drug. In setting that rate,\nHHS relied on an estimate from the Medicare Payment Ad-\nvisory Commission that 340B hospitals obtained prescrip-\ntion drugs at an average discount of at least 22.5 percent\nbelow the average sales price charged by manufacturers.\n\f6         AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 52496, 52499. HHS estimated that the reduction in\nthe reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals would save\nMedicare (and deprive 340B hospitals of ) about $1.6 billion\nannually, which by law would be re-allocated for other Med-\nicare services. Id., at 52509\u201352510. For 2019, HHS set re-\nimbursement rates for 340B hospitals in the same way.\n  When setting the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates,\nHHS acknowledged that it had not conducted a survey of\nhospitals\u2019 acquisition costs\u2014the statutory prerequisite for\nvarying the reimbursement rates by hospital group. Id., at\n52496. Nonetheless, HHS pointed to its statutory authority\nunder option 2 to \u201cadjust\u201d the average price \u201c \u2018as necessary\nfor purposes of \u2019 \u201d this statutory provision. Id., at 52499.\nHHS claimed that its authority to \u201cadjust\u201d the average price\nfor each drug also implicitly encompassed the authority to\nvary the reimbursement rates by hospital group. Ibid.\n                              B\n  The American Hospital Association, along with two other\nhospital industry groups and several hospitals, sued in\nU. S. District Court to challenge HHS\u2019s 2018 and 2019 re-\nimbursement rates for 340B hospitals. Among other things,\nthe Hospitals asserted that HHS did not conduct a survey\nof hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs and therefore could not im-\npose different reimbursement rates on different groups of\nhospitals.\n  In response, HHS first contended that various statutory\nprovisions precluded judicial review of the 2018 and 2019\nreimbursement rates. As relevant here, HHS further ar-\ngued that it could vary the reimbursement rates by hospital\ngroup under its authority to \u201cadjust\u201d the price-based reim-\nbursement rates, even though HHS had not conducted a\nsurvey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs.\n  The District Court ruled for the Hospitals. The court re-\njected HHS\u2019s argument that the statute precluded judicial\nreview. On the merits, the court concluded that HHS had\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Court of Appeals for the D. C.\nCircuit reversed. On the question of judicial review, the\ncourt unanimously ruled that the statute did not preclude\njudicial review. See American Hospital Assn. v. Azar, 967\nF. 3d 818, 824 (2020). On the merits, however, the court\nupheld HHS\u2019s reduced reimbursement rates for 340B hos-\npitals. Id., at 828.\n  In dissent, Judge Pillard contended that HHS\u2019s reduced\nreimbursement rates for 340B hospitals contravened the\ntext and structure of the statute. Id., at 835. In her view,\n\u201cHHS may institute its large reductions, tailored for a dis-\ntinct hospital group,\u201d only if the agency has conducted the\nrequired survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs.

By contrast, when HHS sets rates for outpatient pre-\nscription drugs, it uses a different payment methodology\u2014\nnamely, the methodology specified by paragraph (14) of\n\u00a71395l(t). And nothing in the statute precludes judicial re-\nview of reimbursement rates set under paragraph (14).\n   HHS further argues that allowing judicial review of the\n2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates would be impractical\nbecause the agency is required to operate the program on a\nbudget-neutral basis. Due to that budget-neutrality re-\nquirement, HHS says that a judicial ruling invalidating the\n2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates for certain hospitals\nwould require offsets elsewhere in the program. The Hos-\npitals respond that various potential remedies could make\n340B hospitals whole for the past shortfalls without run-\nning afoul of the budget-neutrality provision. At this stage,\nwe need not address potential remedies. Regardless, HHS\u2019s\narguments against judicial review cannot override the text\nof the statute and the traditional presumption in favor of\njudicial review of administrative action.\n   In sum, HHS\u2019s preclusion argument lacks any textual ba-\nsis. We agree with the District Court and the Court of Ap-\npeals that the Medicare statute does not preclude judicial\nreview of the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               III\n   We turn next to the merits. The question is this: If HHS\nhas not conducted a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs,\nmay HHS still vary the reimbursement rates for outpatient\nprescription drugs by hospital group? The answer is no.\n   The 2003 Medicare Act authorizes HHS to set reimburse-\nment rates for covered outpatient prescription drugs pro-\nvided by hospitals. The Act also specifies how HHS must\nset    those    reimbursement       rates.       42    U. S. C.\n\u00a71395l(t)(14)(A). The statute therefore reflects a careful\ncongressional focus not only on the goal of proper reim-\nbursement rates, but also on the appropriate means to that\nend.\n   To reiterate, the statute affords HHS two options for set-\nting reimbursement rates for outpatient drugs. Option 1\napplies if HHS collects \u201chospital acquisition cost survey\ndata\u201d from hospitals. \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(I). If the agency\nhas conducted a survey and collected that data, then HHS\nmay use the data to set reimbursement rates equal to \u201cthe\naverage acquisition cost for the drug.\u201d Ibid. Importantly,\nin that circumstance, HHS may \u201cvary\u201d reimbursement\nrates \u201cby hospital group.\u201d Ibid.\n   By contrast, if HHS does not conduct a survey of hospi-\ntals\u2019 acquisition costs and if acquisition cost data are there-\nfore \u201cnot available,\u201d HHS must instead proceed under op-\ntion 2 and obtain price data from drug manufacturers.\n\u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II). And in that circumstance, HHS\nmust set reimbursement rates based on \u201cthe average price\nfor the drug\u201d as \u201ccalculated and adjusted by the Secretary\nas necessary for purposes of \u201d this statutory provision. Ibid.\nCritically, that second option does not authorize HHS to\nvary reimbursement rates by hospital group. Instead, HHS\nmust set uniform reimbursement rates for all hospitals for\neach covered drug, and the rates must be equal to the aver-\nage price for that drug for that year.\n   HHS\u2019s authority to proceed under option 1 and to vary\n\f10         AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreimbursement rates by hospital group thus depends on\nwhether HHS has obtained acquisition cost survey data\nfrom hospitals. The statute expressly authorizes HHS to\nvary rates by hospital group if HHS has conducted such a\nsurvey. But the statute does not authorize such a variance\nin rates if HHS has not conducted a survey. Cf. Babb v.\nWilkie, 589 U. S. ___, ____ (2020) (slip op., at 12); Sandoz\nInc. v. Amgen Inc., 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 16);\nRussello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983).\n   The statute thus protects all hospitals by imposing an im-\nportant procedural prerequisite\u2014namely, a survey of hos-\npitals\u2019 acquisition costs for prescription drugs\u2014before HHS\nmay target particular groups of hospitals for lower reim-\nbursement rates. The survey allows the agency to deter-\nmine whether there is in fact meaningful, statistically sig-\nnificant variation among hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. The\ndata regarding variation in hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs in\nturn help HHS determine whether and how much it should\nvary the reimbursement rate among hospital groups. See\n\u00a7\u00a71395l(t)(14)(D)(iii)\u2013(iv). But absent that survey data, as\nCongress       determined,      HHS      may      not     make\n\u201cbillion-dollar decisions differentiating among particular\nhospital groups.\u201d 967 F. 3d, at 837 (Pillard, J., dissenting).\n   In this case, all agree that HHS did not conduct a survey\nof hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. See, e.g., 82 Fed. Reg. 52501.\nHHS nonetheless varied the rates by hospital group, fixing\na substantially lower reimbursement rate for 340B hospi-\ntals than for non-340B hospitals.\n   Under the text and structure of the statute, this case is\ntherefore straightforward: Because HHS did not conduct a\nsurvey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs, HHS acted unlawfully\nby reducing the reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals.\n   HHS maintains that there is more to the case than that\nstraightforward analysis would suggest. HHS emphasizes\nthat even when it does not conduct a survey of acquisition\ncosts and thus is required to employ option 2 (based on\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprice), the agency still may \u201cadjus[t]\u201d the average price \u201cas\nnecessary for purposes of \u201d this statutory provision.\n\u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II).\n   It is true that the statutory text of option 2 affords HHS\ndiscretion to adjust the average price. The parties here vig-\norously debate how much HHS may adjust the price. To\nresolve this case, however, we need not determine the scope\nof HHS\u2019s authority to adjust the price up or down.\n   Regardless of the scope of HHS\u2019s authority to \u201cadjust\u201d the\naverage price up or down under the statute, the statute\ndoes not grant HHS authority to vary the reimbursement\nrates by hospital group unless HHS has conducted the re-\nquired survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. Under the\nstatute, varying a rate by hospital group is not a lesser-\nincluded power of adjusting price. Otherwise stated, HHS\u2019s\npower to increase or decrease the price is distinct from its\npower to set different rates for different groups of hospitals.\n   The text of option 2 confirms the point. It requires reim-\nbursement in an \u201camount\u201d that is equal to \u201cthe average\nprice for the drug in the year.\u201d Ibid. The text thus requires\nthe reimbursement rate to be set drug by drug, not hospital\nby hospital or hospital group by hospital group. The only\nitem that the agency is allowed to adjust is the \u201caverage\nprice for the drug in the year.\u201d Ibid. Such an adjustment\ncan consist of moving the average-price number up or down,\nbut it cannot consist of giving a single drug two different\naverage prices for two different groups of hospitals. (Tell-\ningly, before 2018, the agency never used its adjustment au-\nthority to vary reimbursement rates by hospital group.)\n   Moreover, HHS\u2019s contrary interpretation of the statute\u2014\nand its broad understanding of its adjustment authority\u2014\nwould make little sense given the statute\u2019s overall struc-\nture. To proceed under option 1 (based on cost) and vary\nthe rate by hospital group, HHS must conduct a survey. In\nHHS\u2019s view, the agency can decline to conduct a survey and\ncan proceed under option 2, and then can still do everything\n\f12         AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nunder option 2 that it could do under option 1\u2014including\nvarying the reimbursement rates by hospital group. So un-\nder HHS\u2019s interpretation, the agency would never need to\nconduct a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. But why,\nthen, would Congress have constructed this elaborate stat-\nute premised on HHS\u2019s surveys of hospitals\u2019 acquisition\ncosts, including specifying when HHS could vary reim-\nbursement rates by hospital group? HHS has no good an-\nswer to that question.\n   HHS\u2019s interpretation not only would render irrelevant\nthe survey prerequisite for varying reimbursement rates by\nhospital group, but also would render largely irrelevant the\nprovision of the statute that precisely details the require-\nments for surveys of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. See\n\u00a71395l(t)(14)(D). We must hesitate to adopt an interpreta-\ntion that would eviscerate such significant aspects of the\nstatutory text. See, e.g., Chicago v. Fulton, 592 U. S. ___,\n___ (2021) (slip op., at 5); Maine Community Health Options\nv. United States, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 16);\nWhitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457,\n484\u2212485 (2001).\n   In short, the statute allows HHS to set reimbursement\nrates based on average price and affords the agency discre-\ntion to \u201cadjust\u201d the price up or down. But unless HHS con-\nducts a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs, HHS may not\nvary the reimbursement rates by hospital group.\n   As a final argument, HHS insists that Congress could not\nhave intended for the agency to \u201coverpay\u201d 340B hospitals\nfor prescription drugs. But when enacting this statute in\n2003, Congress was well aware that 340B hospitals paid\nless for covered prescription drugs. After all, that had been\nthe law for the duration of the 340B program, which began\nin 1992. In 2003, Congress nonetheless did not see fit to\ndifferentiate 340B hospitals from other hospitals when re-\nquiring that the reimbursement rates be uniform under op-\ntion 2. And for more than a decade after this statute took\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neffect, HHS employed option 2 but did not differentiate\n340B hospitals from other hospitals\u2014an agency practice\nthat was known in the wider hospital industry and in Con-\ngress.\n   If HHS believes that this Medicare reimbursement pro-\ngram overpays 340B hospitals, it may conduct a survey of\nhospitals\u2019 acquisition costs to determine whether and how\nmuch the data justify varying the reimbursement rates by\nhospital group\u2014for example, reducing reimbursement\nrates paid to 340B hospitals as compared to other hospitals.\nOr if the statute\u2019s requirement of an acquisition cost survey\nis bad policy or is working in unintended ways, HHS can\nask Congress to change the law.\n   Of course, if HHS went to Congress, the agency would\npresumably have to confront the other side of the policy\nstory here: 340B hospitals perform valuable services for\nlow-income and rural communities but have to rely on lim-\nited federal funding for support. As amici before this Court,\nmany 340B hospitals contend that the Medicare reimburse-\nment payments at issue here \u201chelp offset the considerable\ncosts\u201d that 340B providers \u201cincur by providing health care\nto the uninsured, underinsured, and those who live far from\nhospitals and clinics.\u201d Brief for 37 State and Regional Hos-\npital Associations as Amici Curiae 7. As the 340B hospitals\nsee it, the \u201cnet effect\u201d of HHS\u2019s 2018 and 2019 rules is \u201cto\nredistribute funds from financially strapped, public and\nnonprofit safety-net hospitals serving vulnerable popula-\ntions\u2014including patients without any insurance at all\u2014to\nfacilities and individuals who are relatively better off.\u201d 967\nF. 3d, at 840 (Pillard, J., dissenting). In other words, in the\nview of those hospitals, HHS\u2019s new rates eliminate the fed-\neral subsidy that has helped keep 340B hospitals afloat. All\nof which is to say that the 340B story may be more compli-\ncated than HHS portrays it. In all events, this Court is not\nthe forum to resolve that policy debate.\n   In sum, after employing the traditional tools of statutory\n\f14        AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v.

Argued November 30, 2021\u2014Decided June 15, 2022\nThe Medicare statute lays out a formula that the Department of Health\n  and Human Services must employ annually to set reimbursement\n  rates for certain outpatient prescription drugs provided by hospitals to\n  Medicare patients. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii). That formula af-\n  fords HHS two options. Option 1 applies if HHS has conducted a sur-\n  vey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs for each covered outpatient drug.\n  Under this option, the agency may set reimbursement rates based on\n  the hospitals\u2019 \u201caverage acquisition cost\u201d for each drug, and may \u201cvary\u201d\n  the reimbursement rates \u201cby hospital group.\u201d \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(I).\n  Absent a survey, option 2 applies, and HHS must set reimbursement\n  rates based on \u201cthe average price\u201d charged by manufacturers for the\n  drug     as    \u201ccalculated   and     adjusted    by   the    Secretary.\u201d\n  \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II). Option 2 does not authorize HHS to vary re-\n  imbursement rates for different hospital groups. From the time these\n  provisions took effect in 2006 until 2018, HHS did not conduct surveys\n  of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs, relied on option 2, set the reimburse-\n  ment rates at about 106 percent, and did not vary those rates by hos-\n  pital group. For 2018, HHS again did not conduct a survey. But this\n  time it issued a final rule establishing separate reimbursement rates\n  for hospitals that serve low-income or rural populations through the\n  340B program and all other hospitals. For 2019, HHS set reimburse-\n  ment rates the same way.\n     The American Hospital Association and other interested parties\n  challenged the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates in federal court.\n  In response, HHS first contended that various statutory provisions\n  precluded judicial review of those rates. The agency also argued that\n\f2             AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    it could vary the reimbursement rates by hospital group under its op-\n    tion 2 authority to \u201cadjust\u201d the price-based reimbursement rates. The\n    District Court rejected HHS\u2019s argument that the statute precluded ju-\n    dicial review, concluded that HHS had acted outside its statutory au-\n    thority, and remanded the case to HHS to consider an appropriate\n    remedy. The D. C. Circuit, however, reversed. The court ruled that\n    the statute did not preclude judicial review, and upheld HHS\u2019s reduced\n    reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals.\nHeld:\n    1. The statute does not preclude judicial review of HHS\u2019s reimburse-\n ment rates. Judicial review of final agency action is traditionally\n available unless \u201ca statute\u2019s language or structure\u201d precludes it, Mach\n Mining, LLC v. EEOC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">575 U.

S. ___, ___. Here, no\n provision in the Medicare statute precludes judicial review of the 2018\n and 2019 reimbursement rates. HHS cites two nearby provisions that\n preclude review of the general payment methodology that HHS em-\n ploys to set rates for other Medicare outpatient services. See\n \u00a7\u00a71395l(t)(12)(A), (C). But HHS sets rates for outpatient prescription\n drugs using a different payment methodology. HHS also argues that\n other statutory requirements would make allowing judicial review of\n the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates impractical. Regardless, such\n arguments cannot override the text of the statute and the traditional\n presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action. Pp.\n 7\u20139.\n    2. Absent a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs, HHS may not vary\n the reimbursement rates only for 340B hospitals; HHS\u2019s 2018 and\n 2019 reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals were therefore unlawful.\n The text and structure of the statute make this a straightforward case.\n Because HHS did not conduct a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs,\n HHS acted unlawfully by reducing the reimbursement rates for 340B\n hospitals. HHS maintains that even when it does not conduct a sur-\n vey, the agency still may \u201cadjus[t]\u201d the average price \u201cas necessary.\u201d\n \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II). But HHS\u2019s power to increase or decrease the\n price is distinct from its power to set different rates for different groups\n of hospitals. Moreover, HHS\u2019s interpretation would make little sense\n given the statute\u2019s overall structure. Under HHS\u2019s interpretation, the\n agency would never need to conduct a survey of acquisition costs if it\n could proceed under option 2 and then do everything under option 2\n that it could do under option 1. That not only would render irrelevant\n the survey prerequisite for varying reimbursement rates by hospital\n group, but also would render largely irrelevant the provision of the\n statute that precisely details the requirements for surveys of hospitals\u2019\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U.

HHS\u2019s total reimbursements to hospi-\ntals for prescription drugs add up to tens of billions of dol-\nlars every year.\n  To set the reimbursement rates for the prescription\ndrugs, HHS has two options under the statute. First, if\nHHS has conducted a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs\nfor the drugs, HHS may set the reimbursement rates based\non the hospitals\u2019 average acquisition costs\u2014that is, the\namount that hospitals pay to acquire the prescription\ndrugs\u2014and may vary the reimbursement rates for different\ngroups of hospitals. Second and alternatively, if HHS has\nnot conducted such a survey, HHS must instead set the re-\nimbursement rates based on the average sales price\ncharged by manufacturers for the drugs (with certain ad-\njustments), and HHS may not vary the reimbursement\n\f2         AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrates for different groups of hospitals.\n   For 2018 and 2019, HHS did not conduct a survey of hos-\npitals\u2019 acquisition costs for outpatient prescription drugs.\nBut HHS nonetheless substantially reduced the reimburse-\nment rates for one group of hospitals\u2014Section 340B hospi-\ntals, which generally serve low-income or rural communi-\nties. For those 340B hospitals, this case has immense\neconomic consequences, about $1.6 billion annually.\n   The question is whether the statute affords HHS discre-\ntion to vary the reimbursement rates for that one group of\nhospitals when, as here, HHS has not conducted the re-\nquired survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs.

Under that 2003 law, HHS must annu-\nally set reimbursement rates for certain outpatient pre-\nscription drugs provided by hospitals. \u00a71395l(t)(14).\n   The Medicare statute meticulously lays out the formula\nthat HHS must employ to set those reimbursement rates.\nAs relevant here, the agency\u2019s reimbursement rate for each\ncovered outpatient prescription drug \u201cshall be equal\u201d to one\nof two measures:\n    \u201c(I) to the average acquisition cost for the drug for that\n    year (which, at the option of the Secretary, may vary by\n    hospital group (as defined by the Secretary based on\n    volume of covered OPD services or other relevant char-\n    acteristics)), as determined by the Secretary taking\n    into account the hospital acquisition cost survey data\n    under subparagraph (D); or\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)               3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201c(II) if hospital acquisition cost data are not available,\n    the average price for the drug in the year established\n    under section 1395u(o) of this title, section 1395w\u20133a\n    of this title, or section 1395w\u20133b of this title, as the case\n    may be, as calculated and adjusted by the Secretary as\n    necessary for purposes of this paragraph.\u201d\n    \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii) (emphasis added).\n   To simplify a bit: Congress afforded HHS two options to\nset the reimbursement rates for hospitals. Option 1 applies\nif the agency has conducted a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisi-\ntion costs\u2014that is, the amount that hospitals pay to acquire\nthe prescription drugs. If the agency has conducted a sur-\nvey and collected that data, HHS may set reimbursement\nrates based on the hospitals\u2019 \u201caverage acquisition cost\u201d for\neach drug.         See \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(I); see also\n\u00a71395l(t)(14)(D) (requirements for conducting surveys of\nhospitals\u2019 drug acquisition costs). Importantly for present\npurposes, if HHS has conducted a survey of hospitals\u2019 ac-\nquisition costs, option 1 authorizes HHS to vary those re-\nimbursement rates for different groups of hospitals.\n   Option 2 applies if HHS has not conducted a survey of\nhospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. In that circumstance, the\nagency must set reimbursement rates based on \u201cthe aver-\nage price\u201d charged by manufacturers for the drug, as \u201ccal-\nculated and adjusted by the Secretary as necessary for pur-\nposes of \u201d this statutory provision. \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II).\nThe statute in turn sets \u201cthe average price\u201d as 106 percent\nof the drug\u2019s average sales price. See ibid. (citing \u00a71395w\u2013\n3a). Critically, option 2 does not authorize HHS to vary re-\nimbursement rates for different groups of hospitals.\n   For more than a decade after those provisions took effect\nin 2006, HHS did not conduct a survey of hospitals\u2019 acqui-\nsition costs. Indeed, HHS has only once attempted to con-\nduct such a survey\u2014in 2020, after this litigation com-\nmenced. At oral argument in this Court, the Government\n\f4          AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained that HHS had not previously attempted to con-\nduct such surveys because the surveys are \u201cvery burden-\nsome on the study takers,\u201d are \u201cvery burdensome on the\nhospitals,\u201d and do not \u201cproduce results that are all that ac-\ncurate.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 41\u201342.\n   As a result, until 2018, HHS consistently relied on option\n2 and set reimbursement rates for each drug based on the\naverage-sales-price data provided by manufacturers. Every\nyear, HHS set the reimbursement rates at about 106 per-\ncent of each covered drug\u2019s average sales price, and HHS\nused the same reimbursement rates for all hospitals. In\nother words, until 2018, HHS never varied the reimburse-\nment rates by hospital group. See Medicare Program: Hos-\npital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory\nSurgical Center Payment Systems and Quality Reporting\nPrograms, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">82 Fed. Reg. 52490</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52494\u201352495 (2017).\n   During its rulemaking for 2018, HHS proposed a change\nto reduce the reimbursement rates only for 340B hospitals.\nImportantly, HHS did not conduct a survey of hospital ac-\nquisition costs. As a policy matter, HHS said that its exist-\ning reimbursement rates resulted in what the agency\nviewed as overpayments to hospitals that serve low-income\nor rural populations through the federal 340B program.\nFederal law requires drug manufacturers to sell prescrip-\ntion drugs to those 340B hospitals at prices below those\npaid by other hospitals. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7256b(a)(1) (setting\na \u201cceiling price\u201d that manufacturers can charge to 340B hos-\npitals). Consistent with the Medicare statute, however,\nHHS historically had reimbursed 340B hospitals for cov-\nered outpatient prescription drugs at the same reimburse-\nment rates that were set for all other hospitals. For 2018,\nHHS said that the uniform reimbursement rates combined\nwith the discounted prices paid by 340B hospitals for pre-\nscription drugs meant that 340B hospitals were able to\n\u201cgenerate significant profits\u201d when they provided the pre-\nscription drugs to Medicare patients. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">82 Fed.

With respect to HHS\u2019s policy\narguments, the 340B hospitals explained that the reim-\nbursement payments for prescription drugs helped those\nhospitals offset the considerable costs of providing\nhealthcare to the uninsured and underinsured in low-\nincome and rural communities. The 340B hospitals pointed\nout, moreover, that Congress had long been aware of the\nsituation. Indeed, the hospitals claimed that Members of\nCongress not only were aware, but actually intended for the\n340B program\u2019s drug reimbursements to subsidize other\nservices provided by 340B hospitals. The hospitals noted\nthat Congress had never singled out 340B hospitals for\nlower Medicare reimbursements for outpatient prescription\ndrugs. Nor, until 2018, had HHS ever done so. Further-\nmore, the 340B hospitals asserted that reducing their reim-\nbursement rates for prescription drugs would force those\nhospitals to eliminate or dramatically curtail other crucial\nprograms that provide a wide range of medical services in\nlow-income and rural communities\u2014such as treatments for\ncancer, mental health issues, opioid addiction, and diabe-\ntes.\n   In the final rule for 2018, HHS decided to establish two\nseparate reimbursement rates: one rate for non-340B hos-\npitals and another rate for 340B hospitals. The reimburse-\nment rate for non-340B hospitals remained at the historical\nrate of approximately 106 percent of the average sales price\nfor each drug. But HHS established a substantially re-\nduced rate for 340B hospitals\u2014a rate equal to 77.5 percent\nof the average sales price for each drug. In setting that rate,\nHHS relied on an estimate from the Medicare Payment Ad-\nvisory Commission that 340B hospitals obtained prescrip-\ntion drugs at an average discount of at least 22.5 percent\nbelow the average sales price charged by manufacturers.\n\f6         AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 52496, 52499. HHS estimated that the reduction in\nthe reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals would save\nMedicare (and deprive 340B hospitals of ) about $1.6 billion\nannually, which by law would be re-allocated for other Med-\nicare services. Id., at 52509\u201352510. For 2019, HHS set re-\nimbursement rates for 340B hospitals in the same way.\n  When setting the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates,\nHHS acknowledged that it had not conducted a survey of\nhospitals\u2019 acquisition costs\u2014the statutory prerequisite for\nvarying the reimbursement rates by hospital group. Id., at\n52496. Nonetheless, HHS pointed to its statutory authority\nunder option 2 to \u201cadjust\u201d the average price \u201c \u2018as necessary\nfor purposes of \u2019 \u201d this statutory provision. Id., at 52499.\nHHS claimed that its authority to \u201cadjust\u201d the average price\nfor each drug also implicitly encompassed the authority to\nvary the reimbursement rates by hospital group. Ibid.\n                              B\n  The American Hospital Association, along with two other\nhospital industry groups and several hospitals, sued in\nU. S. District Court to challenge HHS\u2019s 2018 and 2019 re-\nimbursement rates for 340B hospitals. Among other things,\nthe Hospitals asserted that HHS did not conduct a survey\nof hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs and therefore could not im-\npose different reimbursement rates on different groups of\nhospitals.\n  In response, HHS first contended that various statutory\nprovisions precluded judicial review of the 2018 and 2019\nreimbursement rates. As relevant here, HHS further ar-\ngued that it could vary the reimbursement rates by hospital\ngroup under its authority to \u201cadjust\u201d the price-based reim-\nbursement rates, even though HHS had not conducted a\nsurvey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs.\n  The District Court ruled for the Hospitals. The court re-\njected HHS\u2019s argument that the statute precluded judicial\nreview. On the merits, the court concluded that HHS had\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

On the merits, however, the court\nupheld HHS\u2019s reduced reimbursement rates for 340B hos-\npitals. Id., at 828.\n  In dissent, Judge Pillard contended that HHS\u2019s reduced\nreimbursement rates for 340B hospitals contravened the\ntext and structure of the statute. Id., at 835. In her view,\n\u201cHHS may institute its large reductions, tailored for a dis-\ntinct hospital group,\u201d only if the agency has conducted the\nrequired survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. Ibid.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 594 U. S. ___ (2021).\n                                II\n   HHS first argues that the Medicare statute precludes ju-\ndicial review of the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates.\nSee 42 U. S. C. \u00a71395l(t)(12). The Court of Appeals rejected\nHHS\u2019s preclusion argument, as did the District Court. We\nlikewise conclude that the statute does not preclude judicial\nreview of HHS\u2019s reimbursement rates.\n   This Court has long recognized a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d in\nfavor of judicial review of final agency action. Weyerhaeuser\nCo. v. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U. S. ___,\n___ (2018) (slip op., at 11) (quoting Mach Mining, LLC v.\nEEOC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">575 U.

Judicial review of final\nagency action in an otherwise justiciable case is tradition-\nally available unless \u201ca statute\u2019s language or structure\u201d pre-\ncludes judicial review.

BECERRA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreview of the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates. More-\nover, the detailed statutory formula for the reimbursement\nrates undermines HHS\u2019s suggestion that Congress implic-\nitly granted the agency judicially unreviewable discretion\nto set the reimbursement rates. Cf. Weyerhaeuser Co., 586\nU. S., at ___\u2212___ (slip op., at 13\u221214).\n   HHS cites two provisions\u2014\u00a7\u00a71395l(t)(12)(A) and (C)\u2014\nthat preclude judicial review of HHS\u2019s \u201cdevelopment of the\nclassification system under paragraph (2)\u201d and \u201cperiodic ad-\njustments made under paragraph [(9)].\u201d But both of those\nprovisions refer to the general payment methodology that\nHHS employs to set rates for other Medicare outpatient ser-\nvices. By contrast, when HHS sets rates for outpatient pre-\nscription drugs, it uses a different payment methodology\u2014\nnamely, the methodology specified by paragraph (14) of\n\u00a71395l(t). And nothing in the statute precludes judicial re-\nview of reimbursement rates set under paragraph (14).\n   HHS further argues that allowing judicial review of the\n2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates would be impractical\nbecause the agency is required to operate the program on a\nbudget-neutral basis. Due to that budget-neutrality re-\nquirement, HHS says that a judicial ruling invalidating the\n2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates for certain hospitals\nwould require offsets elsewhere in the program. The Hos-\npitals respond that various potential remedies could make\n340B hospitals whole for the past shortfalls without run-\nning afoul of the budget-neutrality provision. At this stage,\nwe need not address potential remedies. Regardless, HHS\u2019s\narguments against judicial review cannot override the text\nof the statute and the traditional presumption in favor of\njudicial review of administrative action.\n   In sum, HHS\u2019s preclusion argument lacks any textual ba-\nsis. We agree with the District Court and the Court of Ap-\npeals that the Medicare statute does not preclude judicial\nreview of the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               III\n   We turn next to the merits. The question is this: If HHS\nhas not conducted a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs,\nmay HHS still vary the reimbursement rates for outpatient\nprescription drugs by hospital group? The answer is no.\n   The 2003 Medicare Act authorizes HHS to set reimburse-\nment rates for covered outpatient prescription drugs pro-\nvided by hospitals. The Act also specifies how HHS must\nset    those    reimbursement       rates.       42    U. S. C.\n\u00a71395l(t)(14)(A). The statute therefore reflects a careful\ncongressional focus not only on the goal of proper reim-\nbursement rates, but also on the appropriate means to that\nend.\n   To reiterate, the statute affords HHS two options for set-\nting reimbursement rates for outpatient drugs. Option 1\napplies if HHS collects \u201chospital acquisition cost survey\ndata\u201d from hospitals. \u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(I). If the agency\nhas conducted a survey and collected that data, then HHS\nmay use the data to set reimbursement rates equal to \u201cthe\naverage acquisition cost for the drug.\u201d Ibid. Importantly,\nin that circumstance, HHS may \u201cvary\u201d reimbursement\nrates \u201cby hospital group.\u201d Ibid.\n   By contrast, if HHS does not conduct a survey of hospi-\ntals\u2019 acquisition costs and if acquisition cost data are there-\nfore \u201cnot available,\u201d HHS must instead proceed under op-\ntion 2 and obtain price data from drug manufacturers.\n\u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II). And in that circumstance, HHS\nmust set reimbursement rates based on \u201cthe average price\nfor the drug\u201d as \u201ccalculated and adjusted by the Secretary\nas necessary for purposes of \u201d this statutory provision. Ibid.\nCritically, that second option does not authorize HHS to\nvary reimbursement rates by hospital group. Instead, HHS\nmust set uniform reimbursement rates for all hospitals for\neach covered drug, and the rates must be equal to the aver-\nage price for that drug for that year.\n   HHS\u2019s authority to proceed under option 1 and to vary\n\f10         AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreimbursement rates by hospital group thus depends on\nwhether HHS has obtained acquisition cost survey data\nfrom hospitals. The statute expressly authorizes HHS to\nvary rates by hospital group if HHS has conducted such a\nsurvey. But the statute does not authorize such a variance\nin rates if HHS has not conducted a survey. Cf. Babb v.\nWilkie, 589 U. S. ___, ____ (2020) (slip op., at 12); Sandoz\nInc. v. Amgen Inc., 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 16);\nRussello v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\">464 U. S. 16</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1983).\n   The statute thus protects all hospitals by imposing an im-\nportant procedural prerequisite\u2014namely, a survey of hos-\npitals\u2019 acquisition costs for prescription drugs\u2014before HHS\nmay target particular groups of hospitals for lower reim-\nbursement rates. The survey allows the agency to deter-\nmine whether there is in fact meaningful, statistically sig-\nnificant variation among hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. The\ndata regarding variation in hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs in\nturn help HHS determine whether and how much it should\nvary the reimbursement rate among hospital groups. See\n\u00a7\u00a71395l(t)(14)(D)(iii)\u2013(iv). But absent that survey data, as\nCongress       determined,      HHS      may      not     make\n\u201cbillion-dollar decisions differentiating among particular\nhospital groups.\u201d 967 F. 3d, at 837 (Pillard, J., dissenting).\n   In this case, all agree that HHS did not conduct a survey\nof hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. See, e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">82 Fed. Reg. 52501</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nHHS nonetheless varied the rates by hospital group, fixing\na substantially lower reimbursement rate for 340B hospi-\ntals than for non-340B hospitals.\n   Under the text and structure of the statute, this case is\ntherefore straightforward: Because HHS did not conduct a\nsurvey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs, HHS acted unlawfully\nby reducing the reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals.\n   HHS maintains that there is more to the case than that\nstraightforward analysis would suggest. HHS emphasizes\nthat even when it does not conduct a survey of acquisition\ncosts and thus is required to employ option 2 (based on\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprice), the agency still may \u201cadjus[t]\u201d the average price \u201cas\nnecessary for purposes of \u201d this statutory provision.\n\u00a71395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II).\n   It is true that the statutory text of option 2 affords HHS\ndiscretion to adjust the average price. The parties here vig-\norously debate how much HHS may adjust the price. To\nresolve this case, however, we need not determine the scope\nof HHS\u2019s authority to adjust the price up or down.\n   Regardless of the scope of HHS\u2019s authority to \u201cadjust\u201d the\naverage price up or down under the statute, the statute\ndoes not grant HHS authority to vary the reimbursement\nrates by hospital group unless HHS has conducted the re-\nquired survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. Under the\nstatute, varying a rate by hospital group is not a lesser-\nincluded power of adjusting price. Otherwise stated, HHS\u2019s\npower to increase or decrease the price is distinct from its\npower to set different rates for different groups of hospitals.\n   The text of option 2 confirms the point. It requires reim-\nbursement in an \u201camount\u201d that is equal to \u201cthe average\nprice for the drug in the year.\u201d Ibid. The text thus requires\nthe reimbursement rate to be set drug by drug, not hospital\nby hospital or hospital group by hospital group. The only\nitem that the agency is allowed to adjust is the \u201caverage\nprice for the drug in the year.\u201d Ibid. Such an adjustment\ncan consist of moving the average-price number up or down,\nbut it cannot consist of giving a single drug two different\naverage prices for two different groups of hospitals. (Tell-\ningly, before 2018, the agency never used its adjustment au-\nthority to vary reimbursement rates by hospital group.)\n   Moreover, HHS\u2019s contrary interpretation of the statute\u2014\nand its broad understanding of its adjustment authority\u2014\nwould make little sense given the statute\u2019s overall struc-\nture. To proceed under option 1 (based on cost) and vary\nthe rate by hospital group, HHS must conduct a survey. In\nHHS\u2019s view, the agency can decline to conduct a survey and\ncan proceed under option 2, and then can still do everything\n\f12         AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nunder option 2 that it could do under option 1\u2014including\nvarying the reimbursement rates by hospital group. So un-\nder HHS\u2019s interpretation, the agency would never need to\nconduct a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. But why,\nthen, would Congress have constructed this elaborate stat-\nute premised on HHS\u2019s surveys of hospitals\u2019 acquisition\ncosts, including specifying when HHS could vary reim-\nbursement rates by hospital group? HHS has no good an-\nswer to that question.\n   HHS\u2019s interpretation not only would render irrelevant\nthe survey prerequisite for varying reimbursement rates by\nhospital group, but also would render largely irrelevant the\nprovision of the statute that precisely details the require-\nments for surveys of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs. See\n\u00a71395l(t)(14)(D). We must hesitate to adopt an interpreta-\ntion that would eviscerate such significant aspects of the\nstatutory text. See, e.g., Chicago v. Fulton, 592 U. S. ___,\n___ (2021) (slip op., at 5); Maine Community Health Options\nv. United States, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 16);\nWhitman v.

But unless HHS con-\nducts a survey of hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs, HHS may not\nvary the reimbursement rates by hospital group.\n   As a final argument, HHS insists that Congress could not\nhave intended for the agency to \u201coverpay\u201d 340B hospitals\nfor prescription drugs. But when enacting this statute in\n2003, Congress was well aware that 340B hospitals paid\nless for covered prescription drugs. After all, that had been\nthe law for the duration of the 340B program, which began\nin 1992. In 2003, Congress nonetheless did not see fit to\ndifferentiate 340B hospitals from other hospitals when re-\nquiring that the reimbursement rates be uniform under op-\ntion 2. And for more than a decade after this statute took\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neffect, HHS employed option 2 but did not differentiate\n340B hospitals from other hospitals\u2014an agency practice\nthat was known in the wider hospital industry and in Con-\ngress.\n   If HHS believes that this Medicare reimbursement pro-\ngram overpays 340B hospitals, it may conduct a survey of\nhospitals\u2019 acquisition costs to determine whether and how\nmuch the data justify varying the reimbursement rates by\nhospital group\u2014for example, reducing reimbursement\nrates paid to 340B hospitals as compared to other hospitals.\nOr if the statute\u2019s requirement of an acquisition cost survey\nis bad policy or is working in unintended ways, HHS can\nask Congress to change the law.\n   Of course, if HHS went to Congress, the agency would\npresumably have to confront the other side of the policy\nstory here: 340B hospitals perform valuable services for\nlow-income and rural communities but have to rely on lim-\nited federal funding for support. As amici before this Court,\nmany 340B hospitals contend that the Medicare reimburse-\nment payments at issue here \u201chelp offset the considerable\ncosts\u201d that 340B providers \u201cincur by providing health care\nto the uninsured, underinsured, and those who live far from\nhospitals and clinics.\u201d Brief for 37 State and Regional Hos-\npital Associations as Amici Curiae 7. As the 340B hospitals\nsee it, the \u201cnet effect\u201d of HHS\u2019s 2018 and 2019 rules is \u201cto\nredistribute funds from financially strapped, public and\nnonprofit safety-net hospitals serving vulnerable popula-\ntions\u2014including patients without any insurance at all\u2014to\nfacilities and individuals who are relatively better off.\u201d 967\nF. 3d, at 840 (Pillard, J., dissenting). In other words, in the\nview of those hospitals, HHS\u2019s new rates eliminate the fed-\neral subsidy that has helped keep 340B hospitals afloat. All\nof which is to say that the 340B story may be more compli-\ncated than HHS portrays it. In all events, this Court is not\nthe forum to resolve that policy debate.\n   In sum, after employing the traditional tools of statutory\n\f14        AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSN. v. BECERRA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation, we do not agree with HHS\u2019s interpretation\nof the statute. We conclude that, absent a survey of hospi-\ntals\u2019 acquisition costs, HHS may not vary the reimburse-\nment rates for 340B hospitals. HHS\u2019s 2018 and 2019 reim-\nbursement rates for 340B hospitals were therefore contrary\nto the statute and unlawful.\n                        *     *    *\n  We reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for\nthe D. C.

Argued April 19, 2022\u2014Decided June 15, 2022\nWhen petitioner Kevin George joined the Marine Corps in 1975, he did\n not disclose his history of schizophrenic episodes, and a medical exam-\n ination noted no mental disorders. After George suffered an episode\n during training, the Marines medically discharged him. George then\n applied to the Department of Veterans Affairs under 38 U. S. C. \u00a71110\n for veterans\u2019 disability benefits based on his schizophrenia. A regional\n office of the VA denied George\u2019s claim, and the VA\u2019s Board of Veterans\u2019\n Appeals denied his appeal in 1977.\n    In 2014, George asked the Board to revise its final decision. When\n the VA denies a benefits claim, that decision generally becomes \u201cfinal\n and conclusive and may not be reviewed by any other official or by any\n court\u201d after the veteran exhausts the opportunity for direct appeal.\n \u00a7511(a); see \u00a77104(a). But George sought collateral review under a\n statutory exception allowing a veteran to seek revision of a final bene-\n fits decision at any time on grounds of \u201cclear and unmistakable error.\u201d\n \u00a7\u00a75109A, 7111; see 38 CFR \u00a7\u00a73.105, 20.1400\u201320.1411. In particular,\n he claimed that the Board clearly and unmistakably erred by applying\n a later invalidated regulation to deny his claim for benefits without\n holding the VA to its burden of proof to rebut the statutory presump-\n tion that he was in sound condition when he entered service.\n    The Board denied George\u2019s claim for collateral relief, and the Veter-\n ans Court affirmed. The Federal Circuit also affirmed, concluding that\n the application of a later invalidated regulation does not fall into the\n narrow category of \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d permitting revision\n of a final decision under 38 U. S.

Pp. 5\u201312.\n       (a) This case turns on the meaning of the 1997 statute subjecting a\n    final veterans\u2019 benefits decision to collateral review on grounds of\n    \u201cclear and unmistakable error.\u201d 111 Stat. 2271 (38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a75109A,\n    7111). No statute defines the term \u201cclear and unmistakable error,\u201d but\n    the modifiers \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cunmistakable\u201d as well as the statutory struc-\n    ture suggest a narrow category. A robust regulatory backdrop fills in\n    the details. Where Congress employs a term of art \u201c \u2018 \u201cobviously trans-\n    planted from another legal source,\u201d \u2019 it \u2018 \u201cbrings the old soil with it.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n    Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U. S. ___, ___. That principle applies here.\n    The Court agrees with the Federal Circuit that Congress \u201ccodif[ied]\n    and adopt[ed] the [clear-and-unmistakable-error] doctrine as it had\n    developed under\u201d decades of prior agency practice. Cook v. Principi,\n    318 F. 3d 1334, 1344 (en banc). That history reveals that this category\n    of error does not encompass a subsequent \u201cchange in law . . . or a\n    change in interpretation of law.\u201d 38 CFR \u00a73.105 (Cum. Supp. 1963).\n    And the invalidation of a prior regulation constitutes a \u201cchange in in-\n    terpretation of law\u201d under historical agency practice. Defined by this\n    regulatory history, the statutory term \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d\n    does not encompass a claim like George\u2019s. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (b) In response, George argues that the VA has distorted the history\n    of agency practice that the 1997 statute codified. But across a century\n    of review for clear and unmistakable error, George can muster only\n    one uncertain outlier case sustaining a claim that arguably resembles\n    his, which does not move the mountain of contrary regulatory author-\n    ity. He alternatively argues that the VA is wrong to call a later deci-\n    sion invalidating a regulation a \u201cchange in interpretation of law.\u201d But\n    that is a perfectly natural use of language. George tries to bolster his\n    position by invoking cases explaining that a judicial decision states\n    what the statute \u201calways meant,\u201d Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511\n    U. S. 298, 313, n. 12, and an unauthorized regulation is a \u201c \u2018nullity,\u2019 \u201d\n    Dixon v. United States, 381 U. S. 68, 74. But those general principles\n    do not disturb the conclusion that the Board\u2019s application of a then-\n    binding regulation is not the kind of \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d\n    for which collateral relief is available under \u00a7\u00a75109A and 7111. And\n    that longstanding VA approach is consistent with the general rule that\n    the new interpretation of a statute can only retroactively affect deci-\n    sions still open on direct review.\n       George also leans on what he describes as the plain meaning of the\n    words \u201cclear and unmistakable error.\u201d But as he concedes elsewhere,\n    the real question is not what might be called clear and unmistakable\n    error in the abstract, but what the prevailing understanding of this\n    term of art was when Congress codified it. The fact that Congress did\n    not expressly enact the specific regulatory principle barring collateral\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

When the Department of Veterans Affairs\n(VA) denies a benefits claim, that decision generally be-\ncomes final after the veteran exhausts the opportunity for\ndirect appeal. But a statutory exception permits the vet-\neran to seek collateral review at any time on grounds of\n\u201cclear and unmistakable error.\u201d We must decide whether\nthat exception allows relief from a VA decision applying an\nagency regulation that, although unchallenged at the time,\nis later deemed contrary to law. We hold that it does not.\n                             I\n                             A\n   \u201cThe law entitles veterans who have served on active\nduty in the United States military to receive benefits for\ndisabilities caused or aggravated by their military service.\u201d\nShinseki v. Sanders, 556 U. S. 396, 400 (2009); see 38\nU. S. C. \u00a71110. A veteran seeking such benefits must first\nfile a claim with the VA. \u00a75101(a)(1)(A). A regional office\n\f2                  GEORGE v. MCDONOUGH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof the VA then determines whether the veteran satisfies all\nlegal prerequisites, including the requirement that military\nservice caused or aggravated the disability. \u00a7511(a); see 38\nCFR \u00a73.100(a) (2021). To that end, the statute governing\nwartime service imposes a \u201c[p]resumption of sound condi-\ntion\u201d: If a veteran\u2019s disability was not noted at the time of\nentry into service, then the veteran is presumptively enti-\ntled to benefits unless the VA shows by a heightened bur-\nden of proof that the disability \u201cexisted before . . . and was\nnot aggravated by such service.\u201d 38 U. S. C. \u00a71111. After\napplying this and other statutory and regulatory require-\nments, the regional office issues an initial decision granting\nor denying benefits. \u00a7\u00a7511(a), 5104(a).\n   A veteran dissatisfied with this decision may challenge it\nthrough several layers of direct review. As a general rule,\nthe veteran may appeal within one year to the VA\u2019s Board\nof Veterans\u2019 Appeals (Board). \u00a7\u00a77105(b)(1), 7104(a). If the\nBoard also denies relief, the veteran may seek further re-\nview outside the agency. Such review was once limited to\nconstitutional and certain statutory claims, but since 1988\nCongress has generally allowed veterans 120 days to appeal\nany Board decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans\nClaims (Veterans Court). See Henderson v. Shinseki, 562\nU. S. 428, 432, and n. 1 (2011); \u00a7\u00a77252(a), 7261(a), 7266(a).\nA veteran dissatisfied with that court\u2019s decision may seek\nreview of any legal issue in the Federal Circuit and ulti-\nmately in this Court. \u00a77292; 28 U. S. C. \u00a71254(1).\n   After this direct appeal process, the benefits decision gen-\nerally becomes \u201cfinal and conclusive and may not be re-\nviewed by any other official or by any court.\u201d 38 U. S. C.\n\u00a7511(a); see \u00a77104(a). Still, the veteran enjoys a few limited\noptions for seeking collateral review in exceptional circum-\nstances. E.g., \u00a75108(a) (supplemental claim based on new\nand relevant evidence); \u00a7503(a) (discretionary relief based\non administrative error); \u00a75110(g) (increase of benefits\nbased on subsequent liberalizing legal change).\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

This\nform of collateral review was first adopted by regulation\nroughly 100 years ago. Since at least 1928, the VA and its\npredecessor agencies have allowed revision of an otherwise\nfinal decision when \u201cobviously warranted by a clear and un-\nmistakable error.\u201d Veterans\u2019 Bureau Reg. No. 187, pt. 1,\n\u00a77155 (1928); see 38 CFR \u00a73.105(a) (Cum. Supp. 1963)\n(\u201cPrevious determinations . . . will be accepted as correct in\nthe absence of clear and unmistakable error\u201d). In 1997,\nCongress codified this form of review in the statute we in-\nterpret today. 111 Stat. 2271.\n                              B\n   Kevin George joined the Marine Corps in 1975 after ex-\nperiencing multiple schizophrenic episodes. He did not ini-\ntially disclose that history, and a medical examination\nnoted no mental disorders at the time he entered service.\nBut less than a week into training, George had another ep-\nisode and was hospitalized. A few months later, the Navy\u2019s\nCentral Physical Evaluation Board found that his schizo-\nphrenia made him unfit for duty and was not aggravated by\nservice. App. to Brief for Petitioner 12a\u201315a. George was\nthen medically discharged.\n   Later that year, George applied for veterans\u2019 disability\nbenefits based on his schizophrenia. A VA regional office\ndenied his claim after concluding that his condition pre-\ndated his military service and was not aggravated by it.\nThe Board agreed and denied George\u2019s appeal in 1977. In\nso ruling, neither the regional office nor the Board expressly\ndiscussed the VA\u2019s burden of proof under the presumption\nof sound condition.\n\f4                 GEORGE v. MCDONOUGH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 2014, George asked the Board to revise that final deci-\nsion on grounds of \u201cclear and unmistakable error.\u201d 38\nU. S. C. \u00a77111. In particular, he claimed that the Board\nerred by applying a later invalidated regulation to deny his\nclaim for benefits without holding the VA to its full burden\nof proof to rebut the statutory presumption of sound condi-\ntion. For more than 40 years, including George\u2019s time in\nservice, a VA regulation provided that the agency could re-\nbut the presumption simply by showing, according to a\nheightened burden of proof, that a disability predated ser-\nvice. See 26 Fed. Reg. 1580 (1961); 38 CFR \u00a73.304(b) (1976).\nIn 2003, however, the VA concluded that this regulation\nconflicted with the statute, which it now understood to re-\nquire an additional showing (by the same burden of proof ):\nthat the veteran\u2019s condition was not later aggravated by\nservice. VA Op. Gen. Counsel Precedent (VA Op.) 3\u20132003\n(July 16, 2003). The VA recognized that it seemed \u201cillogi-\ncal\u201d to require an additional showing with \u201cno obvious bear-\ning upon the presumed fact of whether the veteran was in\nsound condition when he or she entered service.\u201d Id., at 8.\nBut it explained that the statutory text nonetheless \u201ccom-\npel[led]\u201d this reading. Ibid. Based on this about-face, the\nVA confessed error in a pending case applying the regula-\ntion, and the Federal Circuit agreed that this \u201cdifficult to\nparse\u201d and \u201csomewhat self-contradictory\u201d statute rendered\nthe regulation \u201cincorrect.\u201d Wagner v. Principi, 370 F. 3d\n1089, 1093, 1097 (2004). The VA ultimately amended the\nregulation to resolve the issue going forward. 70 Fed. Reg.\n23027 (2005).\n   The Board denied George\u2019s claim for collateral relief, and\nthe Veterans Court affirmed. The Federal Circuit also af-\nfirmed, concluding that the application of a later invali-\ndated regulation does not fall into the narrow category of\n\u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d permitting revision of a fi-\nnal decision under 38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a75109A and 7111. 991 F. 3d\n1227 (2021). We granted certiorari. 595 U. S. ___ (2022).\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a75109A, 7111). Neither this statute\nnor any other defines this term\u2014indeed, it appears no-\nwhere else in the entire United States Code. The modifiers\n\u201cclear\u201d and \u201cunmistakable\u201d indicate that this is a narrow\ncategory excluding some forms of error cognizable in other\ncontexts. The statutory structure similarly suggests a nar-\nrow category because this form of review functions as a lim-\nited exception to finality, in contrast to the broad provision\nof one direct appeal for \u201c[a]ll questions\u201d in a case. \u00a77104(a).\nBut beyond those general contours, the statute itself does\nnot identify the specific ways in which this category is nar-\nrower than garden-variety \u201cerror.\u201d\n   Fortunately, a robust regulatory backdrop fills in the de-\ntails. Where Congress employs a term of art \u201c \u2018 \u201cobviously\ntransplanted from another legal source,\u201d \u2019 it \u2018 \u201cbrings the old\nsoil with it.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U. S. ___, ___\n(2019) (slip op., at 5). That principle applies here. In 1997,\nCongress used an unusual term that had a long regulatory\nhistory in this very context. It enacted no new \u201cdefinition\u201d\nor other provision indicating any departure from the \u201csame\nmeaning\u201d that the VA had long applied. Hall v. Hall, 584\nU. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 13). We therefore agree\nwith the Federal Circuit that Congress \u201ccodif[ied] and\nadopt[ed] the [clear-and-unmistakable-error] doctrine as it\nhad developed under\u201d prior agency practice. Cook v. Prin-\ncipi, 318 F. 3d 1334, 1344 (2002) (en banc). That longstand-\ning VA practice reveals several respects in which the clear-\nand-unmistakable category is a \u201cvery specific and rare kind\nof error\u201d narrower than error simpliciter.            38 CFR\n\u00a720.1403(a).\n   Most important for present purposes, the history reveals\n\f6                  GEORGE v. MCDONOUGH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat this category of error does not encompass a subsequent\n\u201cchange in law . . . or a change in interpretation of law.\u201d 38\nCFR \u00a73.105 (Cum. Supp. 1963). And for good reason: Dur-\ning the many years when clear and unmistakable error was\npurely a creature of regulation, the governing statutes gen-\nerally did not allow \u201c[n]ew or recently developed facts or\nchanges in the law\u201d to \u201cprovide a basis for revising a finally\ndecided case.\u201d Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313\n(1992) (en banc) (citing 38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a75108, 7104). To stay\nwithin that statutory constraint, authorities dating back to\n1928 confirm that \u201c[a] determination that there was \u2018clear\nand unmistakable error\u2019 must be based on the record and\nthe law that existed at the time of the prior [VA] decision.\u201d\n3 Vet. App., at 314 (emphasis added); see 38 CFR\n\u00a720.1403(b) (similar); Veterans\u2019 Bureau Reg. No. 187, pt. 1,\n\u00a77155 (requiring \u201cclear and unmistakable error shown by\nthe evidence in file at the time the prior decision was ren-\ndered\u201d). So, for example, the VA\u2019s failure to apply an exist-\ning regulation to undisputed record evidence could consti-\ntute clear and unmistakable error.            E.g., Myler v.\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 571, 574\u2013575 (1991). But a subse-\nquent legal change could not, because \u201conly the \u2018law that\nexisted at the time\u2019 of the prior adjudication . . . can be con-\nsidered\u201d in this posture. Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242,\n246 (1994). Or as the Veterans Court summed up, shortly\nbefore the enactment of the 1997 statute: A \u201cnew interpre-\ntation of law . . . from a case decided in 1993 could not pos-\nsibly be the basis of [clear and unmistakable] error in 1969,\u201d\nas \u201ca simple recitation of the time sequence\u201d should \u201cmake\n. . . clear.\u201d Berger v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 166, 170 (1997).\n    The invalidation of a prior regulation constitutes a\n\u201cchange in interpretation of law\u201d under historical agency\npractice. Drawing on decades of history, the VA succinctly\nexplained nearly 30 years ago that review for clear and un-\nmistakable error provides \u201cno authority . . . for retroactive\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

VA Op. 9\u201394, \u00b66, p. 5 (Mar. 25,\n1994). Under this practice and the statute codifying it, the\nBoard is instead simply \u201cperforming its assigned task when\nit applies a regulation as promulgated by the [VA],\u201d because\nthat regulation legally binds agency adjudicators. VA Op.\n25\u201395, \u00b64, p. 2 (Dec. 6, 1995); see 38 U. S. C. \u00a77104(c) (\u201cThe\nBoard shall be bound in its decisions by the regulations of\nthe Department\u201d). To be sure, when a previously applied\nregulation is later invalidated, relief may be warranted for\n\u201cerror\u201d in a case still on direct appeal. E.g., Wagner, 370\nF. 3d, at 1092, 1097. But on collateral review of a final de-\ncision, the more limited category of \u201c[c]lear and unmistaka-\nble error does not include the otherwise correct application\nof a statute or regulation where, subsequent to the Board\ndecision challenged, there has been a change in the inter-\npretation of the statute or regulation.\u201d            38 CFR\n\u00a720.1403(e). The applicability of this principle does not de-\n              1\n\npend on the reason why the agency changed course: A\nchange based on the conclusion that a prior interpretation\nwas wrong is still a changed interpretation.\n   Defined by this regulatory history, the statutory term\n\u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d does not encompass a claim\nlike George\u2019s. When the Board decided George\u2019s appeal in\n1977, it followed the then-applicable 1961 regulation, as it\nwas statutorily obligated to do. See 38 U. S. C. \u00a77104(c).\nDecades later, the VA and the Federal Circuit rejected that\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 As should be clear from our explanation, the principal dissent is\n\nwrong to attribute to the Court the view that an agency decision in these\ncircumstances is \u201cinfected by no error of any kind.\u201d Post, at 4 (opinion of\nGORSUCH, J.). The issue in this case is the distinction between \u201cerrors\u201d\ncognizable on direct appeal and clear and unmistakable errors cognizable\non collateral review. Throughout his opinion, JUSTICE GORSUCH elides\nthat distinction.\n\f8                 GEORGE v. MCDONOUGH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nregulation based on a new interpretation of the \u201csound con-\ndition\u201d provision. We express no view on the merits of that\nchange in interpretation, which are not before us. But be-\ncause it is a change, it cannot support a claim of clear and\nunmistakable error in the Board\u2019s routine 1977 application\nof the prior regulation. Put differently, the correct applica-\ntion of a binding regulation does not constitute \u201cclear and\nunmistakable error\u201d at the time a decision is rendered, even\nif that regulation is subsequently invalidated.\n                              B\n                              1\n   George offers several responses. He generally concedes\nthe premise that the 1997 statute codified the longstanding\nregulatory practice defining \u201cclear and unmistakable er-\nror.\u201d He takes issue primarily with the conclusion that this\npractice forbids his claim. In George\u2019s view, the VA has\n\u201cdistorted\u201d its own history by glossing over a handful of\n\u201cpre-legislation Veterans Court opinions\u201d that he claims\n\u201cpoint in [his] direction.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 26, 41. But\nacross a century of review for clear and unmistakable error,\nGeorge can muster only one case sustaining a claim that\narguably resembles his. See Look v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App.\n157 (1992) (approving collateral relief on two grounds, in-\ncluding a later invalidated regulation, without discussing\nthe change-in-interpretation principle). And even that case\nis ambiguous, as portions of the opinion may instead \u201csug-\ngest that the [subsequent] invalidation of regulations does\nnot have retroactive effect in \u2018finally\u2019 disallowed claims.\u201d\nVA Op. 9\u201394, \u00b65, p. 4 (emphasis added) (citing Look, 2 Vet.\nApp., at 164). Regardless, the case remains an outlier that\n\u201cno court has cited\u201d on this point \u201c[i]n the 30 years since,\u201d\nas the Government notes without rebuttal from George.\nBrief for Respondent 38.\n   This is thin stuff.

When we say that a statute adopts\na term of art, we mean that it captures \u201cthe state of [a] body\nof law,\u201d not every errant decision of arguable relevance.\nFederal Republic of Germany v. Philipp, 592 U. S. ___, ___\n(2021) (slip op., at 9). Even if George could pluck from the\ncrowd a few stray decisions pointing his way, that would\nnot show a \u201c \u2018settled\u2019 meaning\u201d that we can infer \u201cCongress\nhad . . . in mind when it enacted\u201d this statute. Return Mail,\nInc. v. Postal Service, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at\n15). Instead, the mainstream of agency practice settles that\na clear-and-unmistakable-error claim cannot rest on a sub-\nsequent change in interpretation.\n   George alternatively argues that the VA erred in apply-\ning this principle to his situation. In his view, it is wrong\nto describe a later decision invalidating a regulation as a\n\u201cchange in interpretation of law.\u201d But we think that is a\nperfectly natural way to characterize a decision announcing\na new reading of a statute\u2014much as the VA and Federal\nCircuit did in the decisions on which George now relies. VA\nOp. 3\u20132003, \u00b6\u00b63, 8, pp. 2, 5 (adopting a new \u201cinterpretation\u201d\nto replace the prior \u201cinterpretation reflected in VA\u2019s regula-\ntions\u201d); Wagner, 370 F. 3d, at 1092 (discussing that \u201cchange\nin agency interpretation\u201d). We have occasionally used sim-\nilar language ourselves. E.g., Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S.\n524, 536\u2013537 (2005) (referring to \u201c[t]he change in the law\nworked by\u201d our precedent \u201cinterpret[ing] the AEDPA stat-\nute of limitations\u201d). As the Federal Circuit has explained,\na lack of \u201caccuracy\u201d in a prior statutory interpretation \u201cdoes\nnot negate the fact that\u201d it is an \u201cinitial interpretation.\u201d\nJordan v. Nicholson, 401 F. 3d 1296, 1298 (2005). In short,\na misinterpretation is still an interpretation, and a correc-\ntion of that interpretation is a change. So the VA\u2019s applica-\ntion of the change-in-interpretation label to claims like\nGeorge\u2019s hardly reflects an \u201catypical\u201d use of language, de-\nspite his arguments to the contrary. Brief for Petitioner 18.\n\f10                 GEORGE v. MCDONOUGH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Ordinary language aside, George tries to bolster his posi-\ntion with analogies to precedent from other contexts. He\ninvokes an array of cases explaining that a judicial decision\nstates what the statute \u201calways meant,\u201d Rivers v. Roadway\nExpress, Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 313, n. 12 (1994), and an unau-\nthorized regulation is a \u201c \u2018nullity,\u2019 \u201d Dixon v. United States,\n381 U. S. 68, 74 (1965). True enough. Those general prin-\nciples, however, do not dispose of the issue before us. As-\nsume George is right that the \u201csound condition\u201d provision\nalways required the VA to show that the veteran\u2019s condition\nwas not later aggravated by service and that the 1961 reg-\nulation conflicted with that requirement. We would still\nhave to decide whether the Board\u2019s application of that bind-\ning regulation is the kind of \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d\nfor which collateral relief is available under 38 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a75109A and 7111. For the reasons we have explained, it\nis not.\n   And while George suggests otherwise, there is nothing in-\ncongruous about a system in which this kind of error\u2014the\napplication of a since-rejected statutory interpretation\u2014\ncannot be remedied after final judgment. On the contrary,\nand as the lower courts have explained, the VA\u2019s longstand-\ning approach is consistent with the general rule that \u201c[t]he\nnew interpretation of a statute can only retroactively\n[a]ffect decisions still open on direct review.\u201d Disabled\nAmerican Veterans v. Gober, 234 F. 3d 682, 698 (CA Fed.\n2001) (citing Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S.\n86, 97 (1993)); see also Smith v. West, 11 Vet.

That limitation serves important\ninterests in finality, preventing narrow avenues for collat-\neral review from ballooning into \u201csubstitute[s] for ordinary\nerror correction through appeal.\u201d Harrington v.

Re-\nply Brief 2. As he puts it: \u201cLooking at the 1977 Board\u2019s de-\ncision today, the legal error is clear. It is unmistakable.\u201d\nId., at 1. (This is the thrust of JUSTICE GORSUCH\u2019s position\ntoo. See post, at 3\u20135 (dissenting opinion).) We share the\nGovernment\u2019s doubt about how natural it is to say that the\nBoard \u201ccommit[ted] \u2018clear and unmistakable error\u2019 by faith-\nfully applying a VA regulation that was found to be invalid\nmore than 25 years later.\u201d Brief for Respondent 33. More\nfundamentally, though, this argument is inconsistent with\nGeorge\u2019s well-taken concessions elsewhere that \u201cthe [clear-\nand-unmistakable-error] statutes track preexisting Veter-\nans Court case law\u201d and other agency practice defining a\n\u201cdeeply rooted\u201d regulatory standard. Reply Brief 8; Brief\nfor Petitioner 6. The real question is not what might be\ncalled clear and unmistakable error in the abstract, but\nwhat was the \u201cprevailing understanding\u201d of this term of art\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The principal dissent claims that this conclusion conflicts with the\n\ngoverning statute\u2019s present-tense statement that a VA decision \u201c \u2018is sub-\nject\u2019 to later \u2018revision\u2019 \u201d on collateral review. Post, at 5 (opinion of\nGORSUCH, J.). But it would make little sense for Congress to pass a stat-\nute stating that a decision \u201cwas\u201d subject to revision. The statute\u2019s use of\nthe present tense refers to the time at which relief may be sought. It\nsays nothing about the scope of the category of clear and unmistakable\nerrors meriting relief, as fixed by the regulatory history. So we think\nthere are good reasons why neither George nor any of his amici makes\nthis argument.\n\f12                 GEORGE v.

To the extent they diverge, the\nhistorical meaning controls.\n    More modestly, George seeks to distinguish the statutory\nmeaning from the prior practice on just one point. Because\nCongress did not expressly enact the specific regulatory\nprinciple barring collateral relief for subsequent changes in\ninterpretation, he insists that the principle did not carry\nover to the statute. But this argument, too, misses the\nmark. The point of the old-soil principle is that \u201cwhen Con-\ngress employs a term of art,\u201d that usage itself suffices to\n\u201c \u2018adop[t] the cluster of ideas that were attached to each bor-\nrowed word\u2019 \u201d in the absence of indication to the contrary.\nFAA v.

As JUSTICE GORSUCH explains, in the context of\nthis specific statutory framework, the mere fact that the\nBoard relied on a plainly invalid regulation does not shield\nits final decision from review based on clear and unmistak-\nable error.1\n   The Court thinks otherwise. In support of its holding, the\nCourt notes that Congress, when it enacted the clear-and-\nunmistakable-error statutes in 1997, codified a pre-existing\nregulatory doctrine under which clear and unmistakable er-\nror did not encompass a subsequent \u201cchange in interpreta-\ntion of law.\u201d 38 CFR \u00a73.105 (Cum. Supp. 1963); see ante, at\n5\u20136. I agree that Congress incorporated this pre-existing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In my view, some invalid Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regu-\n\nlations might not be erroneous enough for reliance on them to constitute\nclear and unmistakable error. After all, by definition, not every error is\nclear and unmistakable. The Board\u2019s 1977 decision in George\u2019s case,\nhowever, meets this demanding standard. The presumption-of-sound-\nness regulation the Board applied was clearly and unmistakably con-\ntrary to the unambiguous terms of 38 U. S. C. \u00a71111, as even the VA\neventually conceded.

See ante, at 5, 12.2\nI diverge from JUSTICE GORSUCH on this point. The ques-\ntion remains, however: What constitutes a \u201cchange in inter-\npretation of law\u201d excluded from clear and unmistakable er-\nror? In George\u2019s view, a change in interpretation of law\noccurs where \u201can agency . . . choos[es] another permissible\nalternative construction\u201d of a statute, but not where, as\nhere, a court invalidates a regulation that had egregiously\nviolated the governing statute all along. Brief for Petitioner\n18; see also post, at 4\u20135 (GORSUCH, J., dissenting).\n   The Court disagrees. It holds that under the pre-existing\ndoctrine, judicial invalidation of an unmistakably errone-\nous regulation was understood to constitute a \u201cchange in\ninterpretation of law\u201d for purposes of clear and unmistaka-\nble error. See ante, at 5\u20139. The Court\u2019s citations offer little\nsupport for this conclusion, however. In Berger v. Brown,\n10 Vet. App. 166, 170 (1997), for example, the Court of Vet-\nerans Appeals (Veterans Court) stated that opinions from\nthat body \u201cthat formulate new interpretations of the law . . .\ncannot be the basis of a valid [clear-and-unmistakable-er-\nror] claim.\u201d But the Veterans Court emphasized that the\ndecision under attack, unlike the Board\u2019s decision in\nGeorge\u2019s case, had followed \u201ca plausible interpretation of\nthe law,\u201d precluded by \u201cnothing in the plain language of the\nstatute,\u201d and added that \u201c[t]he statute was, and still is for\nthat matter, susceptible of differing interpretations.\u201d Ibid.\nSimilarly, in Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet.

See H. R. Rep. No. 105\u201352, pp. 1\u20132 (1997) (\u201cH.

And although it\nwas well established by 1997 that clear and unmistakable\nerror \u201cmust be based on . . . the law that existed at the time\nof the prior . . . decision,\u201d Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet.

Gen. Counsel Prece-\ndent 9\u201394, \u00b6\u00b66, 8, pp. 4\u20135 (Mar. 25). Meanwhile, the Vet-\nerans Court\u2019s 1992 decision in Look v. Derwinski, 2 Vet.\nApp. 157, while not a model of clarity, undeniably \u201cap-\nprov[ed of] collateral relief \u201d based on \u201ca later invalidated\nregulation,\u201d as the Court recognizes. Ante, at 8.\n    My takeaway from these conflicting authorities is that\nthe pre-existing doctrine Congress incorporated in 1997\nwas unsettled as to whether judicial invalidation of a regu-\nlation that squarely contravened an unambiguous statute\nconstituted a \u201cchange in interpretation of law.\u201d In other\nwords, where the Court perceives certainty, I see at most\nconfusion. Confronted with an ambiguity in the scheme\nCongress codified into statute, I would apply the venerable\n\u201c \u2018canon that provisions for benefits to members of the\nArmed Services are to be construed in the beneficiaries\u2019 fa-\nvor.\u2019 \u201d Henderson v.

To make matters\nworse, the agency even faulted Mr. George for failing to\ncarry his supposed burden of \u201csupport[ing] a claim for ag-\ngravation.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 86a.\n   Eventually, virtually everyone came to agree that the ad-\nministrative regulations on which the VA relied in deciding\nMr. George\u2019s case defied the statutory terms Congress pre-\nscribed in \u00a7 1111. In 2003, the agency\u2019s General Counsel\nadmitted as much. See VA Op. Gen. Counsel Precedent 3\u2013\n2003, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 9. The following year, the Federal Circuit held\nthat the statute \u201cclear[ly]\u201d forbade the VA\u2019s rules. Wagner\nv. Principi, 370 F. 3d 1089, 1094 (2004).\n   After the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in Wagner, Mr.\nGeorge asked the agency to reconsider his case under the\ncorrect standard set forth in \u00a7 1111. Understandably so.\nCongress has directed the VA to revise any prior adminis-\ntrative benefits decision infected with \u201cclear and unmistak-\nable error.\u201d 38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 5109A (regional office), 7111 (vet-\nerans board).      Congress has further instructed that\nveterans may petition for review under this standard \u201cat\nany time.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 5109A(d), 7111(d). Yet, despite these direc-\ntions, the agency in 2016 refused to reopen Mr. George\u2019s\ncase. To justify its decision, the agency reasoned that \u201cju-\ndicial decisions that offer new interpretations of the law\nsubsequent to a VA decision cannot be the basis of a\u201d claim\nfor clear and unmistakable error under the terms of\n\u00a7\u00a7 5109A and 7111. App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a. A divided\npanel of the Veterans Court, a non-Article III tribunal, af-\nfirmed. See George v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 364 (2019). So\ndid the Federal Circuit. 991 F. 3d 1227 (2021).\n                           II\n                           A\n  I would reverse. In \u00a7 1111, Congress provided veterans\n\f4                  GEORGE v. MCDONOUGH\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nwith a presumption of soundness and required the govern-\nment to prove by clear and convincing evidence that any\ncondition a veteran suffered was not aggravated by service.\nToday, however, everyone accepts that the regulations the\nagency relied on to reject Mr. George\u2019s initial claim imper-\nmissibly failed to implement these statutory commands.\nOn any reasonable account, that amounts to a clear and un-\nmistakable agency error entitling Mr. George to a new hear-\ning. Regardless whether he can prevail under the test Con-\ngress actually prescribed in \u00a7 1111, he is at least entitled to\na hearing consistent with the law\u2019s terms. The agency\u2019s\nfailure to provide him that simple (and legally compelled)\ncourtesy is inexcusable.\n   Of course, just how badly the agency\u2019s regulations de-\nparted from Congress\u2019s commands in \u00a7 1111 may not have\nbeen widely appreciated until the Federal Circuit high-\nlighted the problem in Wagner. But a \u201cjudicial construction\nof a statute is an authoritative statement of what the stat-\nute meant before as well as after the decision.\u201d Rivers v.\nRoadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 311\u2013313 (1994). And\nan agency\u2019s \u201c \u2018regulation which . . . operates to create a rule\nout of harmony with the statute, is a mere nullity.\u2019 \u201d Dixon\nv. United States, 381 U. S. 68, 74 (1965). From these prem-\nises, it follows that the agency\u2019s ruling in this case, depend-\ning as it did on a statutorily impermissible regulation, was\ninfected by \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d that Mr. George\nis entitled to have corrected \u201cat any time.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 5109A, 7111.\n                              B\n  What is the Court\u2019s reply? It highlights the fact that the\nagency\u2019s regulations bound its own internal administrative\ndecisionmakers when they ruled on Mr. George\u2019s initial\nclaim. Given that, the Court says, the agency\u2019s ruling was\nperfectly sound at the time, infected by no error of any kind,\nlet alone clear and unmistakable error. Of course, the Fed-\n\f                   Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                5\n\n                      GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\neral Circuit in Wagner later held that the agency\u2019s regula-\ntions \u201cclear[ly]\u201d defied its statutory charge from Congress.\n370 F. 3d, at 1094. But, on the Court\u2019s view today, that de-\ncision represented a change in governing law. See ante, at\n7, 9.\n   A clear and unmistakable agency error cannot be made\nto vanish so easily. Even if an agency\u2019s unlawful regula-\ntions may bind its own employees until a court says other-\nwise, that does not mean its decisions applying those regu-\nlations to others are error-free. The regulations on which\nthe VA relied in this case always defied Congress\u2019s express\ncommand in \u00a7 1111. In that sense, they were always a\n\u201c \u2018nullity.\u2019 \u201d Dixon, 381 U. S., at 74. Nor does it make a dif-\nference that Wagner recognized as much only some time\nlater. Once more, when a court interprets a statute and\ndeclares contrary regulations invalid, it cannot and does not\nchange the law; it can only explain what the law has \u201cal-\nways meant.\u201d Rivers, 511 U. S., at 313, n. 12. The Court\ntoday errs badly by excusing an obvious error simply be-\ncause it was once enshrined by the agency in a statutorily\ndefiant regulation.\n   What is more, the Court\u2019s reading is at odds with the\nplain terms of \u00a7\u00a7 5109A and 7111. Under those statutes,\nan initial administrative ruling denying benefits \u201cis sub-\nject\u201d to later \u201crevision . . . [i]f evidence establishes the [clear\nand unmistakable] error.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 5109A(a), 7111(a) (emphasis\nadded). Notice the tense. The law does not ask if the\nagency\u2019s error was \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d at the time of\nits original decision. Instead, it commands the agency to\ncorrect any clear and unmistakable error presently estab-\nlished. The same statutes further instruct that a petition\n\u201cto determine whether clear and unmistakable error exists\nin a case may be instituted\u201d in various ways. \u00a7\u00a7 5109A(c),\n7111(c) (emphasis added). More present tense. Congress\neasily could have said that a decision is reviewable only\n\f6                  GEORGE v. MCDONOUGH\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nwhere an error was \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d from the out-\nset. It did not. Instead, Congress instructed the agency to\nassess whether\u2014from its present vantage\u2014one of its prior\nadministrative rulings suffers from a \u201cclear and unmistak-\nable error.\u201d\n                               C\n   Perhaps sensing these problems with its primary theory,\nthe Court offers a second and slightly different one. Now it\ninsists that the phrase \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d is a\nterm of art that originated in (still other) agency regula-\ntions. Ante, at 5. Under those regulations, the Court ob-\nserves, an error did not qualify as \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d\nif it was based on a \u201cchange in law or . . . a change in inter-\npretation of law.\u201d 38 CFR \u00a7 3.105 (Cum. Supp. 1963); see\nante, at 6. On the Court\u2019s telling, Congress meant to incor-\nporate this same standard when it adopted \u00a7\u00a7 5109A and\n7111. And, the Court continues, that standard precludes\nrelief in this case because the error here is apparent only\nthanks to the Federal Circuit\u2019s intervening Wagner deci-\nsion, which represented a \u201cchange in interpretation of law.\u201d\nSee ante, at 6\u20138.\n   This argument is no more persuasive than the last.\nWhen Congress \u201ctransform[s] . . . a regulatory procedure\n[in]to a statutory form of relief,\u201d we enforce only those com-\nponents Congress actually \u201ccodif[ied]\u201d in the statutory text.\nKucana v. Holder, 558 U. S. 233, 249\u2013250 (2010) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). And here Congress did not cod-\nify the part of the old agency regulation on which the Court\nrelies. Nothing in the text of \u00a7 5109A or \u00a7 7111 says that\nerrors resulting from \u201cchanges in law\u201d or \u201cchanges in inter-\npretation\u201d are immune from correction. To the contrary,\nCongress omitted this language from the agency\u2019s prior reg-\nulations when it adopted \u00a7\u00a7 5109A and 7111. Under the\nlaw Congress actually wrote, prior agency decisions are\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             7\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\n\u201csubject to revision on the grounds of clear and unmistaka-\nble error.\u201d Full stop. This Court should not be in the busi-\nness of adding words to the law, let alone to insulate badly\nmistaken agency decisions from any chance of correction.\n                              III\n  In the end, it is hard to avoid the impression that the\nCourt thinks an old agency ruling in Mr. George\u2019s case just\nisn\u2019t worth revisiting. See ante, at 10. Maybe, too, that\nmight seem an understandable impulse on first encounter.\nAfter all, in civil and criminal litigation new judicial inter-\npretations about a law\u2019s meaning normally do not apply to\nold cases after they have reached final judgment. See, e.g.,\nHarper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86, 94\u201397\n(1993).\n  But it turns out that impulse is doubly misguided here.\nFor one thing, it is a mistake to equate veteran benefits\ncases with ordinary civil and criminal litigation. Recogniz-\ning the sacrifices of those who have left private life to serve\ntheir country, Congress has ordained that a veteran may\npetition for review of clear and unmistakable errors in past\nadministrative decisions \u201cat any time.\u201d           \u00a7\u00a7 5109A(d),\n7111(d). Congress\u2019s \u201cwhole purpose\u201d in setting up this\nscheme was \u201cto make an exception to [the usual rule of] fi-\nnality\u201d for our veterans in recognition of their service to the\nNation. Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 529 (2005).\n  For another thing, this case doesn\u2019t just affect Mr.\nGeorge. It risks insulating countless other decisions in\nwhich the Department has wrongly denied veteran benefits\nbased on self-serving regulations inconsistent with Con-\ngress\u2019s instructions. See, e.g., Brief for National Veterans\nLegal Services Program et al. as Amici Curiae 15\u201327; Brief\nfor Swords to Plowshares et al. as Amici Curiae 19\u201320. Vet-\nerans already face challenges enough in dealing with the\nDepartment. On average, the agency takes seven years to\n\f8                 GEORGE v. MCDONOUGH\n\n                   GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nprocess their administrative appeals. See Brief for Na-\ntional Law School Veterans Clinic Consortium as Amicus\nCuriae 18. Over the past five years, it seems that the Vet-\nerans Court has affirmed less than 10 percent of the\nagency\u2019s decisions. See ibid. Internal audits have revealed\nmassive numbers of improperly denied claims. See id.,\nat 19. I would not add to these problems by shielding the\nDepartment from the inconvenience of having to answer for\nits own clear and unmistakable errors.

Argued April 19, 2022\u2014Decided June 15, 2022\nWhen petitioner Kevin George joined the Marine Corps in 1975, he did\n not disclose his history of schizophrenic episodes, and a medical exam-\n ination noted no mental disorders. After George suffered an episode\n during training, the Marines medically discharged him. George then\n applied to the Department of Veterans Affairs under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">38 U. S.

A regional\n office of the VA denied George\u2019s claim, and the VA\u2019s Board of Veterans\u2019\n Appeals denied his appeal in 1977.\n    In 2014, George asked the Board to revise its final decision.

The Federal Circuit also affirmed, concluding that\n the application of a later invalidated regulation does not fall into the\n narrow category of \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d permitting revision\n of a final decision under 38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a75109A and 7111.\nHeld: The invalidation of a VA regulation after a veteran\u2019s benefits deci-\n sion becomes final cannot support a claim for collateral relief based on\n\f2                        GEORGE v.

No statute defines the term \u201cclear and unmistakable error,\u201d but\n    the modifiers \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cunmistakable\u201d as well as the statutory struc-\n    ture suggest a narrow category. A robust regulatory backdrop fills in\n    the details.

Defined by this\n    regulatory history, the statutory term \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d\n    does not encompass a claim like George\u2019s. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (b) In response, George argues that the VA has distorted the history\n    of agency practice that the 1997 statute codified. But across a century\n    of review for clear and unmistakable error, George can muster only\n    one uncertain outlier case sustaining a claim that arguably resembles\n    his, which does not move the mountain of contrary regulatory author-\n    ity. He alternatively argues that the VA is wrong to call a later deci-\n    sion invalidating a regulation a \u201cchange in interpretation of law.\u201d But\n    that is a perfectly natural use of language. George tries to bolster his\n    position by invoking cases explaining that a judicial decision states\n    what the statute \u201calways meant,\u201d Rivers v.

But those general principles\n    do not disturb the conclusion that the Board\u2019s application of a then-\n    binding regulation is not the kind of \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d\n    for which collateral relief is available under \u00a7\u00a75109A and 7111. And\n    that longstanding VA approach is consistent with the general rule that\n    the new interpretation of a statute can only retroactively affect deci-\n    sions still open on direct review.\n       George also leans on what he describes as the plain meaning of the\n    words \u201cclear and unmistakable error.\u201d But as he concedes elsewhere,\n    the real question is not what might be called clear and unmistakable\n    error in the abstract, but what the prevailing understanding of this\n    term of art was when Congress codified it.

The modifiers\n\u201cclear\u201d and \u201cunmistakable\u201d indicate that this is a narrow\ncategory excluding some forms of error cognizable in other\ncontexts. The statutory structure similarly suggests a nar-\nrow category because this form of review functions as a lim-\nited exception to finality, in contrast to the broad provision\nof one direct appeal for \u201c[a]ll questions\u201d in a case. \u00a77104(a).\nBut beyond those general contours, the statute itself does\nnot identify the specific ways in which this category is nar-\nrower than garden-variety \u201cerror.\u201d\n   Fortunately, a robust regulatory backdrop fills in the de-\ntails. Where Congress employs a term of art \u201c \u2018 \u201cobviously\ntransplanted from another legal source,\u201d \u2019 it \u2018 \u201cbrings the old\nsoil with it.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U. S. ___, ___\n(2019) (slip op., at 5). That principle applies here. In 1997,\nCongress used an unusual term that had a long regulatory\nhistory in this very context. It enacted no new \u201cdefinition\u201d\nor other provision indicating any departure from the \u201csame\nmeaning\u201d that the VA had long applied. Hall v. Hall, 584\nU.

We therefore agree\nwith the Federal Circuit that Congress \u201ccodif[ied] and\nadopt[ed] the [clear-and-unmistakable-error] doctrine as it\nhad developed under\u201d prior agency practice. Cook v. Prin-\ncipi, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">318 F. 3d 1334</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1344 (2002) (en banc). That longstand-\ning VA practice reveals several respects in which the clear-\nand-unmistakable category is a \u201cvery specific and rare kind\nof error\u201d narrower than error simpliciter.            </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">38 CFR\n\u00a720.1403</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a).\n   Most important for present purposes, the history reveals\n\f6                  GEORGE v.

And for good reason: Dur-\ning the many years when clear and unmistakable error was\npurely a creature of regulation, the governing statutes gen-\nerally did not allow \u201c[n]ew or recently developed facts or\nchanges in the law\u201d to \u201cprovide a basis for revising a finally\ndecided case.\u201d Russell v.

To stay\nwithin that statutory constraint, authorities dating back to\n1928 confirm that \u201c[a] determination that there was \u2018clear\nand unmistakable error\u2019 must be based on the record and\nthe law that existed at the time of the prior [VA] decision.\u201d\n3 Vet.

So, for example, the VA\u2019s failure to apply an exist-\ning regulation to undisputed record evidence could consti-\ntute clear and unmistakable error.

But on collateral review of a final de-\ncision, the more limited category of \u201c[c]lear and unmistaka-\nble error does not include the otherwise correct application\nof a statute or regulation where, subsequent to the Board\ndecision challenged, there has been a change in the inter-\npretation of the statute or regulation.\u201d            </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">38 CFR\n\u00a720.1403</span><pre class=\"inline\">(e).

But be-\ncause it is a change, it cannot support a claim of clear and\nunmistakable error in the Board\u2019s routine 1977 application\nof the prior regulation.

But\nacross a century of review for clear and unmistakable error,\nGeorge can muster only one case sustaining a claim that\narguably resembles his. See Look v.

Those general prin-\nciples, however, do not dispose of the issue before us. As-\nsume George is right that the \u201csound condition\u201d provision\nalways required the VA to show that the veteran\u2019s condition\nwas not later aggravated by service and that the 1961 reg-\nulation conflicted with that requirement. We would still\nhave to decide whether the Board\u2019s application of that bind-\ning regulation is the kind of \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d\nfor which collateral relief is available under 38 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a75109A and 7111.

As JUSTICE GORSUCH explains, in the context of\nthis specific statutory framework, the mere fact that the\nBoard relied on a plainly invalid regulation does not shield\nits final decision from review based on clear and unmistak-\nable error.1\n   The Court thinks otherwise. In support of its holding, the\nCourt notes that Congress, when it enacted the clear-and-\nunmistakable-error statutes in 1997, codified a pre-existing\nregulatory doctrine under which clear and unmistakable er-\nror did not encompass a subsequent \u201cchange in interpreta-\ntion of law.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">38 CFR \u00a73.105</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cum.

After all, by definition, not every error is\nclear and unmistakable. The Board\u2019s 1977 decision in George\u2019s case,\nhowever, meets this demanding standard.

See ante, at 5, 12.2\nI diverge from JUSTICE GORSUCH on this point. The ques-\ntion remains, however: What constitutes a \u201cchange in inter-\npretation of law\u201d excluded from clear and unmistakable er-\nror? In George\u2019s view, a change in interpretation of law\noccurs where \u201can agency . . . choos[es] another permissible\nalternative construction\u201d of a statute, but not where, as\nhere, a court invalidates a regulation that had egregiously\nviolated the governing statute all along. Brief for Petitioner\n18; see also post, at 4\u20135 (GORSUCH, J., dissenting).\n   The Court disagrees. It holds that under the pre-existing\ndoctrine, judicial invalidation of an unmistakably errone-\nous regulation was understood to constitute a \u201cchange in\ninterpretation of law\u201d for purposes of clear and unmistaka-\nble error. See ante, at 5\u20139. The Court\u2019s citations offer little\nsupport for this conclusion, however. In Berger v. Brown,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Vet. App. 166</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 170 (1997), for example, the Court of Vet-\nerans Appeals (Veterans Court) stated that opinions from\nthat body \u201cthat formulate new interpretations of the law . . .\ncannot be the basis of a valid [clear-and-unmistakable-er-\nror] claim.\u201d But the Veterans Court emphasized that the\ndecision under attack, unlike the Board\u2019s decision in\nGeorge\u2019s case, had followed \u201ca plausible interpretation of\nthe law,\u201d precluded by \u201cnothing in the plain language of the\nstatute,\u201d and added that \u201c[t]he statute was, and still is for\nthat matter, susceptible of differing interpretations.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ibid.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\nSimilarly, in Damrel v.

Understandably so.\nCongress has directed the VA to revise any prior adminis-\ntrative benefits decision infected with \u201cclear and unmistak-\nable error.\u201d 38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 5109A (regional office), 7111 (vet-\nerans board).      Congress has further instructed that\nveterans may petition for review under this standard \u201cat\nany time.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 5109A(d), 7111(d). Yet, despite these direc-\ntions, the agency in 2016 refused to reopen Mr. George\u2019s\ncase. To justify its decision, the agency reasoned that \u201cju-\ndicial decisions that offer new interpretations of the law\nsubsequent to a VA decision cannot be the basis of a\u201d claim\nfor clear and unmistakable error under the terms of\n\u00a7\u00a7 5109A and 7111.

Regardless whether he can prevail under the test Con-\ngress actually prescribed in \u00a7 1111, he is at least entitled to\na hearing consistent with the law\u2019s terms. The agency\u2019s\nfailure to provide him that simple (and legally compelled)\ncourtesy is inexcusable.\n   Of course, just how badly the agency\u2019s regulations de-\nparted from Congress\u2019s commands in \u00a7 1111 may not have\nbeen widely appreciated until the Federal Circuit high-\nlighted the problem in Wagner. But a \u201cjudicial construction\nof a statute is an authoritative statement of what the stat-\nute meant before as well as after the decision.\u201d Rivers v.\nRoadway Express, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117842\"><a href=\"/opinion/117842/rivers-v-roadway-express-inc/\">511 U.

From these prem-\nises, it follows that the agency\u2019s ruling in this case, depend-\ning as it did on a statutorily impermissible regulation, was\ninfected by \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d that Mr. George\nis entitled to have corrected \u201cat any time.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 5109A, 7111.\n                              B\n  What is the Court\u2019s reply? It highlights the fact that the\nagency\u2019s regulations bound its own internal administrative\ndecisionmakers when they ruled on Mr. George\u2019s initial\nclaim. Given that, the Court says, the agency\u2019s ruling was\nperfectly sound at the time, infected by no error of any kind,\nlet alone clear and unmistakable error.

But, on the Court\u2019s view today, that de-\ncision represented a change in governing law. See ante, at\n7, 9.\n   A clear and unmistakable agency error cannot be made\nto vanish so easily. Even if an agency\u2019s unlawful regula-\ntions may bind its own employees until a court says other-\nwise, that does not mean its decisions applying those regu-\nlations to others are error-free. The regulations on which\nthe VA relied in this case always defied Congress\u2019s express\ncommand in \u00a7 1111. In that sense, they were always a\n\u201c \u2018nullity.\u2019 \u201d Dixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107048\"><a href=\"/opinion/107048/dixon-v-united-states/\">381 U.

The Court\ntoday errs badly by excusing an obvious error simply be-\ncause it was once enshrined by the agency in a statutorily\ndefiant regulation.\n   What is more, the Court\u2019s reading is at odds with the\nplain terms of \u00a7\u00a7 5109A and 7111. Under those statutes,\nan initial administrative ruling denying benefits \u201cis sub-\nject\u201d to later \u201crevision . . . [i]f evidence establishes the [clear\nand unmistakable] error.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 5109A(a), 7111(a) (emphasis\nadded). Notice the tense. The law does not ask if the\nagency\u2019s error was \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d at the time of\nits original decision. Instead, it commands the agency to\ncorrect any clear and unmistakable error presently estab-\nlished. The same statutes further instruct that a petition\n\u201cto determine whether clear and unmistakable error exists\nin a case may be instituted\u201d in various ways. \u00a7\u00a7 5109A(c),\n7111(c) (emphasis added).

Instead, Congress instructed the agency to\nassess whether\u2014from its present vantage\u2014one of its prior\nadministrative rulings suffers from a \u201cclear and unmistak-\nable error.\u201d\n                               C\n   Perhaps sensing these problems with its primary theory,\nthe Court offers a second and slightly different one. Now it\ninsists that the phrase \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d is a\nterm of art that originated in (still other) agency regula-\ntions. Ante, at 5. Under those regulations, the Court ob-\nserves, an error did not qualify as \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d\nif it was based on a \u201cchange in law or . . . a change in inter-\npretation of law.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">38 CFR \u00a7 3.105</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cum. Supp. 1963); see\nante, at 6. On the Court\u2019s telling, Congress meant to incor-\nporate this same standard when it adopted \u00a7\u00a7 5109A and\n7111. And, the Court continues, that standard precludes\nrelief in this case because the error here is apparent only\nthanks to the Federal Circuit\u2019s intervening Wagner deci-\nsion, which represented a \u201cchange in interpretation of law.\u201d\nSee ante, at 6\u20138.\n   This argument is no more persuasive than the last.\nWhen Congress \u201ctransform[s] . . . a regulatory procedure\n[in]to a statutory form of relief,\u201d we enforce only those com-\nponents Congress actually \u201ccodif[ied]\u201d in the statutory text.\nKucana v.

Nothing in the text of \u00a7 5109A or \u00a7 7111 says that\nerrors resulting from \u201cchanges in law\u201d or \u201cchanges in inter-\npretation\u201d are immune from correction. To the contrary,\nCongress omitted this language from the agency\u2019s prior reg-\nulations when it adopted \u00a7\u00a7 5109A and 7111. Under the\nlaw Congress actually wrote, prior agency decisions are\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

This Court should not be in the busi-\nness of adding words to the law, let alone to insulate badly\nmistaken agency decisions from any chance of correction.\n                              III\n  In the end, it is hard to avoid the impression that the\nCourt thinks an old agency ruling in Mr. George\u2019s case just\nisn\u2019t worth revisiting. See ante, at 10. Maybe, too, that\nmight seem an understandable impulse on first encounter.\nAfter all, in civil and criminal litigation new judicial inter-\npretations about a law\u2019s meaning normally do not apply to\nold cases after they have reached final judgment. See, e.g.,\nHarper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112890\"><a href=\"/opinion/112890/harper-v-virginia-dept-of-taxation/\">509 U. S. 86</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94\u201397\n(1993).\n  But it turns out that impulse is doubly misguided here.\nFor one thing, it is a mistake to equate veteran benefits\ncases with ordinary civil and criminal litigation. Recogniz-\ning the sacrifices of those who have left private life to serve\ntheir country, Congress has ordained that a veteran may\npetition for review of clear and unmistakable errors in past\nadministrative decisions \u201cat any time.\u201d           \u00a7\u00a7 5109A(d),\n7111(d). Congress\u2019s \u201cwhole purpose\u201d in setting up this\nscheme was \u201cto make an exception to [the usual rule of] fi-\nnality\u201d for our veterans in recognition of their service to the\nNation.

S. 524</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (2005).\n  For another thing, this case doesn\u2019t just affect Mr.\nGeorge. It risks insulating countless other decisions in\nwhich the Department has wrongly denied veteran benefits\nbased on self-serving regulations inconsistent with Con-\ngress\u2019s instructions. See, e.g., Brief for National Veterans\nLegal Services Program et al. as Amici Curiae 15\u201327; Brief\nfor Swords to Plowshares et al. as Amici Curiae 19\u201320.

Argued March 22, 2022\u2014Decided June 15, 2022\nThe Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Ab-\n  duction requires the judicial or administrative authority of a Contract-\n  ing State to order a child returned to the child\u2019s country of habitual\n  residence if the authority finds that the child has been wrongfully re-\n  moved to or retained in the Contracting State. The authority \u201cis not\n  bound to order the return of the child,\u201d however, if the authority finds\n  that return would expose the child to a \u201cgrave risk\u201d of \u201cphysical or psy-\n  chological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situa-\n  tion.\u201d The International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA) im-\n  plements the Convention in the United States, granting federal and\n  state courts jurisdiction over Convention actions and directing those\n  courts to decide cases in accordance with the Convention.\n     Petitioner Narkis Golan, a United States citizen, married respond-\n  ent Isacco Saada, an Italian citizen, in Italy, where they had a son,\n  B. A. S., in 2016. In 2018, Golan flew with B. A. S. to the United States\n  to attend a wedding and, instead of returning to Italy, moved into a\n  domestic violence shelter with B. A. S. Saada thereafter timely filed a\n  petition with the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of New\n  York, seeking an order returning B. A. S. to Italy pursuant to the\n  Hague Convention. The District Court concluded that B. A. S. would\n  face a grave risk of harm if returned to Italy, given evidence that Saada\n  had abused Golan and that being exposed to this abuse harmfully af-\n  fected B. A. S. The court, however, ordered B. A. S.\u2019 return to Italy, ap-\n  plying Second Circuit precedent obligating it to \u201cexamine the full\n  range of options that might make possible the safe return of a child\u201d\n  and concluding that ameliorative measures could reduce the risk to\n  B. A. S. sufficiently to require his return. The Second Circuit vacated\n  the return order, finding the District Court\u2019s ameliorative measures\n\f2                           GOLAN v. SAADA\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    insufficient. Because the record did not support concluding that no\n    sufficient ameliorative measures existed, the Second Circuit remanded\n    for the District Court to consider whether such measures, in fact, ex-\n    isted. After an examination over nine months, the District Court iden-\n    tified new ameliorative measures and again ordered B. A. S.\u2019 return.\n    The Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A court is not categorically required to examine all possible ame-\n liorative measures before denying a Hague Convention petition for re-\n turn of a child to a foreign country once the court has found that return\n would expose the child to a grave risk of harm. Pp. 8\u201316.\n    (a) \u201cThe interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a stat-\n ute, begins with its text.\u201d Abbott v. Abbott, 560 U. S. 1, 10 (internal\n quotation marks omitted). When \u201ca child has been wrongfully re-\n moved or retained\u201d from his country of habitual residence, Article 12\n of the Hague Convention generally requires the deciding authority\n (here, a district court) to \u201corder the return of the child.\u201d T. I. A. S.\n No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99\u201311, p. 9. But Article 13(b) of the\n Convention leaves a court with the discretion to grant or deny return,\n providing that a court \u201cis not bound to order the return of the child\u201d if\n it finds that the party opposing return has established that return\n would expose the child to a \u201cgrave risk\u201d of physical or psychological\n harm. Id., at 10. Nothing in the Convention\u2019s text either forbids or\n requires consideration of ameliorative measures in exercising this dis-\n cretion. Pp. 8\u201311.\n       (1) Saada\u2019s primary argument is that determining whether a\n grave risk of harm exists necessarily requires considering whether any\n ameliorative measures are available. The two questions, however, are\n separate. A court may find it appropriate to consider both questions\n at once, but this does not mean that the Convention imposes a cate-\n gorical requirement on a court to consider any or all ameliorative\n measures before denying return based on a grave-risk determination.\n Pp. 9\u201310.\n       (2) The discretion to courts under the Convention and ICARA in-\n cludes the discretion to determine whether to consider ameliorative\n measures that could ensure the child\u2019s safe return. The Second Cir-\n cuit\u2019s contrary rule\u2014which imposes an atextual, categorical require-\n ment that courts consider all possible ameliorative measures in exer-\n cising discretion under the Convention, regardless of whether such\n consideration is consistent with the Convention\u2019s objectives\u2014\u201cin prac-\n tice, rewrite[s] the treaty,\u201d Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U. S. 1, 17.\n Pp. 10\u201311.\n    (b) A district court\u2019s consideration of ameliorative measures must be\n guided by the legal principles and other requirements set forth in the\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Convention and ICARA. The Second Circuit\u2019s rule improperly ele-\n  vated return above the Convention\u2019s other objectives. The Convention\n  does not pursue return exclusively or at all costs. Courts must remain\n  conscious of all the Convention\u2019s objectives and requirements, which\n  constrain courts\u2019 discretion to consider ameliorative measures. First,\n  the Convention explicitly recognizes that any consideration of amelio-\n  rative measures must prioritize the child\u2019s physical and psychological\n  safety. Second, consideration of ameliorative measures should abide\n  by the Convention\u2019s requirement that courts addressing return peti-\n  tions do not usurp the role of the court that will adjudicate the under-\n  lying custody dispute. Third, any consideration of ameliorative\n  measures must accord with the Convention\u2019s requirement that courts\n  \u201cact expeditiously in proceedings for the return of children.\u201d A court\n  therefore reasonably may decline to consider ameliorative measures\n  that have not been raised by the parties, are unworkable, draw the\n  court into determinations properly resolved in custodial proceedings,\n  or risk overly prolonging return proceedings. Pp. 11\u201315.\n     (c) In this case, the District Court made a finding of grave risk, but\n  never had the opportunity to inquire whether to order or deny return\n  under the correct legal standard. Accordingly, it is appropriate to al-\n  low the District Court to apply the proper legal standard in the first\n  instance, see Monasky v. Taglieri, 589 U. S. ___, ___.

I. A. S. No.\n11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99\u201311 (Treaty Doc.), if a court\nfinds that a child was wrongfully removed from the child\u2019s\ncountry of habitual residence, the court ordinarily must or-\nder the child\u2019s return. There are, however, exceptions to\nthat rule. As relevant here, a court is not bound to order a\nchild\u2019s return if it finds that return would put the child at a\ngrave risk of physical or psychological harm. In such a cir-\ncumstance, a court has discretion to determine whether to\ndeny return.\n   In exercising this discretion, courts often consider\nwhether any \u201cameliorative measures,\u201d undertaken either\n\u201cby the parents\u201d or \u201cby the authorities of the state having\njurisdiction over the question of custody,\u201d could \u201creduce\nwhatever risk might otherwise be associated with a child\u2019s\nrepatriation.\u201d Blondin v.

Taglieri, 589 U. S.\n___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 2) (quoting Convention Pream-\nble, Treaty Doc., at 7). Accordingly, the Convention gener-\nally requires the \u201cprompt return\u201d of a child to the child\u2019s\ncountry of habitual residence when the child has been\nwrongfully removed to or retained in another country.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 3), the\nConvention requires that the determination as to whether\nto order return should be made \u201cus[ing] the most expedi-\ntious procedures available,\u201d Art. 2, Treaty Doc., at 7; see\nalso Art. 11, id., at 9 (providing that the party petitioning\nfor return has \u201cthe right to request a statement of the rea-\nsons for the delay\u201d if the court \u201chas not reached a decision\nwithin six weeks from the date of commencement of the pro-\nceedings\u201d).\n   Congress implemented the Convention in the Interna-\ntional Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 102 Stat.\n437, as amended, 22 U.

ICARA permits\na parent (or other individual or institution) seeking relief\nunder the Convention to file a petition for return of a child\nin state or federal court, \u00a7\u00a79003(a)\u2013(b), and directs courts\nto \u201cdecide the[se] case[s] in accordance with the Conven-\ntion,\u201d \u00a79003(d).

If the court finds the child was wrongfully re-\nmoved or retained, the respondent opposing return of the\nchild has the burden of establishing that an exception to the\nreturn requirement applies. \u00a79003(e)(2). A respondent ar-\nguing that return would expose the child to a grave risk of\nharm must establish that this exception applies by \u201cclear\nand convincing evidence.\u201d \u00a79003(e)(2)(A). Absent a finding\nthat an exception applies, a child determined to be wrong-\nfully removed or retained must be \u201cpromptly returned\u201d to\nthe child\u2019s country of habitual residence. \u00a79001(a)(4).\n                               B\n  Petitioner Narkis Golan is a citizen of the United States.\nShe met respondent Isacco Saada, an Italian citizen, while\nattending a wedding in Milan, Italy, in 2014. Golan soon\nmoved to Milan, and the two wed in August 2015. Their\nson, B. A. S., was born the next summer in Milan, where the\nfamily lived for the first two years of B. A. S.\u2019 life.\n  The following facts, as found by the District Court, are\nnot in dispute. Saada and Golan\u2019s relationship was charac-\nterized by violence from the beginning. The two fought on\nan almost daily basis and, during their arguments, Saada\nwould sometimes push, slap, and grab Golan and pull her\nhair. Saada also yelled and swore at Golan and frequently\ninsulted her and called her names, often in front of other\npeople. Saada once told Golan\u2019s family that he would kill\nher. Much of Saada\u2019s abuse of Golan occurred in front of his\nson.\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

Rather than return as\nscheduled in August, however, Golan moved into a domestic\nviolence shelter with B. A. S. In September, Saada filed in\nItaly a criminal complaint for kidnapping and initiated a\ncivil proceeding seeking sole custody of B. A. S.\n  Saada also filed a petition under the Convention and\nICARA in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District\nof New York, seeking an order for B. A. S.\u2019 return to Italy.\nThe District Court granted Saada\u2019s petition after a 9-day\nbench trial. As a threshold matter, the court determined\nthat Italy was B. A. S.\u2019 habitual residence and that Golan\nhad wrongfully retained B. A. S. in the United States in vi-\nolation of Saada\u2019s rights of custody. The court concluded,\nhowever, that returning B. A. S. to Italy would expose him\nto a grave risk of harm. The court observed that there was\n\u201cno dispute\u201d that Saada was \u201cviolent\u2014physically, psycho-\nlogically, emotionally, and verbally\u2014to\u201d Golan and that \u201cB.\nA. S. was present for much of it.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a.\nThe court described some of the incidents B. A. S. had wit-\nnessed as \u201cchilling.\u201d Ibid. While B. A. S. was not \u201cthe target\nof violence,\u201d undisputed expert testimony established that\n\u201cdomestic violence disrupts a child\u2019s cognitive and social-\nemotional development, and affects the structure and or-\nganization of the child\u2019s brain.\u201d Id., at 79a\u201380a, and n. 37.3\nRecords indicated that Italian social services, who had been\ninvolved with the couple while they lived in Italy, had also\nconcluded that \u201c \u2018the family situation entails a developmen-\ntal danger\u2019 for B. A. S.\u201d Id., at 80a. The court found that\nSaada had demonstrated no \u201ccapacity to change his behav-\nior,\u201d explaining that Saada \u201cminimized or tried to excuse\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The court noted that \u201c[t]here were isolated incidents of possible\n\nabuse\u201d of B. A. S. based on Golan\u2019s testimony that Saada had inadvert-\nently hit and pushed B. A. S. while targeting her and Golan\u2019s brother\u2019s\ntestimony that Saada had spanked B. A. S. aggressively, accusations that\nSaada disputed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a, n. 37; see id., at 54a\u201355a, 61a.\n\f6                          GOLAN v. SAADA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhis violent conduct\u201d during his testimony and that Saada\u2019s\n\u201cown expert said . . . that [Saada] could not control his an-\nger or take responsibility for his behavior.\u201d Ibid.\n   The court nonetheless ordered B. A. S.\u2019 return to Italy\nbased on Second Circuit precedent obligating it to \u201c \u2018exam-\nine the full range of options that might make possible the\nsafe return of a child to the home country\u2019 \u201d before it could\n\u201c \u2018deny repatriation on the ground that a grave risk of harm\nexists.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 81a (quoting Blondin II, 238 F. 3d, at 163,\nn. 11). The Second Circuit based this rule on its view that\nthe Convention requires return \u201cif at all possible.\u201d Blondin\nI, 189 F. 3d, at 248. To comply with these precedents, the\nDistrict Court had required the parties to propose \u201c \u2018amelio-\nrative measures\u2019 \u201d that could enable B. A. S.\u2019 safe return.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 81a.4 Saada had proposed that he\nwould provide Golan with $30,000 for expenses pending a\ndecision in Italian courts as to financial support, stay away\nfrom Golan until the custody dispute was resolved, pursue\ndismissal of the criminal charges he had filed against Go-\nlan, begin cognitive behavioral therapy, and waive any\nright to legal fees or expenses under the Convention. The\ncourt concluded that these measures, combined with the\nfact that Saada and Golan would be living separately,\nwould \u201creduce the occasions for violence,\u201d thereby amelio-\nrating the grave risk to B. A. S. sufficiently to require his\nreturn. Id., at 81a\u201382a.\n   On Golan\u2019s appeal of this return order, the Second Circuit\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Courts of Appeals use the terms \u201cundertakings\u201d and \u201cameliorative\n\nmeasures\u201d interchangeably. See, e.g., Blondin I, 189 F. 3d 240, 248 (CA2\n1999) (referring to \u201cameliorative measures\u201d); Simcox v. Simcox, 511 F. 3d\n594, 604\u2013606 (CA6 2007) (referring to \u201cundertakings\u201d). Although Saada\nasserts that the latter is broader than the former, he does not argue that\nthe difference is determinative in this case. Accordingly, we use \u201came-\nliorative measures,\u201d the term employed by the Second Circuit in this\ncase.\n\f                   Cite as: 596 U.

S. Emphasiz-\ning that the District Court\u2019s factual findings provided \u201cam-\nple reason to doubt that Mr. Saada will comply with these\nconditions,\u201d the Second Circuit concluded that \u201cthe District\nCourt erred in granting the petition subject to (largely) un-\nenforceable undertakings\u201d without \u201csufficient guarantees of\nperformance.\u201d 930 F. 3d 533, 540, 542\u2013543 (2019). Because\nthe record did \u201cnot support the conclusion that there exist\nno protective measures sufficient to ameliorate the grave\nrisk of harm B. A. S. faces if repatriated,\u201d the court re-\nmanded for the District Court to \u201cconsider whether there\nexist alternative ameliorative measures that are either en-\nforceable by the District Court or supported by other suffi-\ncient guarantees of performance.\u201d Id., at 543 (emphasis\nadded).\n   To comply with the Second Circuit\u2019s directive, over the\ncourse of nine months, the District Court conducted \u201can ex-\ntensive examination of the measures available to ensure B.\nA. S.\u2019s safe return to Italy.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a. The\nDistrict Court directed the parties to appear for status con-\nferences and to submit status reports and supplemental\nbriefs, and the court corresponded with the U. S. Depart-\nment of State and the Italian Ministry of Justice. At the\ncourt\u2019s instruction, the parties petitioned the Italian courts\nfor a protective order, and the Italian court overseeing the\nunderlying custody dispute issued a protective order bar-\nring Saada from approaching Golan for one year. In addi-\ntion, the Italian court ordered that an Italian social services\nagency oversee Saada\u2019s parenting classes and therapy and\nthat visits between Saada and B. A. S. be supervised.5\n   The District Court concluded that these measures were\nsufficient to ameliorate the harm to B. A. S. and again\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Separately, the Italian criminal court dismissed the kidnapping\n\ncharges against Golan.\n\f8                         GOLAN v. SAADA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ngranted Saada\u2019s petition for B. A. S.\u2019 return. It rejected Go-\nlan\u2019s argument that Saada could not be trusted to comply\nwith a court order, expressing confidence in the Italian\ncourts\u2019 abilities to enforce the protective order. The District\nCourt additionally ordered Saada to pay Golan $150,000 to\nfacilitate B. A. S.\u2019 return to Italy and to cover Golan\u2019s and B.\nA. S.\u2019 living costs while they resettled. The Second Circuit\naffirmed, concluding that the District Court did not clearly\nerr in determining that Saada likely would comply with the\nItalian protective order, given his compliance with other\ncourt orders and the threat of enforcement by Italian au-\nthorities of its order. 833 Fed. Appx. 829 (2020).\n  This Court granted certiorari to decide whether the Sec-\nond Circuit properly required the District Court, after mak-\ning a grave-risk finding, to examine a full range of possible\nameliorative measures before reaching a decision as to\nwhether to deny return, and to resolve a division in the\nlower courts regarding whether ameliorative measures\nmust be considered after a grave-risk finding.6 595 U.

As described above, when\n\u201ca child has been wrongfully removed or retained\u201d from his\ncountry of habitual residence, Article 12 of the Hague Con-\nvention generally requires the deciding authority (here, a\ndistrict court) to \u201corder the return of the child.\u201d Treaty Doc.,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Compare In re Adan, 437 F. 3d 381, 395 (CA3 2006) (requiring con-\n\nsideration of ameliorative measures); Gaudin v.

Under Article 13(b) of the Convention, however, a\ncourt \u201cis not bound to order the return of the child\u201d if the\ncourt finds that the party opposing return has established\nthat return would expose the child to a \u201cgrave risk\u201d of phys-\nical or psychological harm. Id., at 10. By providing that a\ncourt \u201cis not bound\u201d to order return upon making a grave-\nrisk finding, Article 13(b) lifts the Convention\u2019s return re-\nquirement, leaving a court with the discretion to grant or\ndeny return.\n   Nothing in the Convention\u2019s text either forbids or re-\nquires consideration of ameliorative measures in exercising\nthis discretion. The Convention itself nowhere mentions\nameliorative measures. Nor does ICARA, which, as rele-\nvant, instructs courts to \u201cdecide the case in accordance with\nthe Convention\u201d and accordingly leaves undisturbed the\ndiscretion recognized in the Convention. 22 U. S. C.\n\u00a79003(d). The longstanding interpretation of the Depart-\nment of State offers further support for the view that the\nConvention vests a court with discretion to determine\nwhether to order return if an exception to the return man-\ndate applies. See 51 Fed. Reg. 10510 (1986) (explaining\nthat \u201ca court in its discretion need not order a child re-\nturned\u201d upon a finding of grave risk); see also Abbott, 560\nU. S., at 15 (explaining that the Executive Branch\u2019s inter-\npretation of the Convention \u201cis entitled to great weight\u201d (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Unable to point to any explicit textual mandate that\ncourts consider ameliorative measures, Saada\u2019s primary ar-\ngument is that this requirement is implicit in the Conven-\ntion\u2019s command that the court make a determination as to\nwhether a grave risk of harm exists. Essentially, Saada ar-\ngues that determining whether a grave risk of harm exists\nnecessarily requires considering whether any ameliorative\nmeasures are available.\n   The question whether there is a grave risk, however, is\nseparate from the question whether there are ameliorative\n\f10                          GOLAN v. SAADA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nmeasures that could mitigate that risk. That said, the ques-\ntion whether ameliorative measures would be appropriate\nor effective will often overlap considerably with the inquiry\ninto whether a grave risk exists. See Simcox v. Simcox, 511\nF. 3d 594, 607\u2013608 (CA6 2007) (explaining that the appro-\npriateness and utility of ameliorative measures correlate\nwith the gravity of the risk to the child). In many instances,\na court may find it appropriate to consider both questions\nat once. For example, a finding of grave risk as to a part of\na country where an epidemic rages may naturally lead a\ncourt simultaneously to consider whether return to another\npart of the country is feasible. The fact that a court may\nconsider ameliorative measures concurrent with the grave-\nrisk determination, however, does not mean that the Con-\nvention imposes a categorical requirement on a court to con-\nsider any or all ameliorative measures before denying re-\nturn once it finds that a grave risk exists.7\n   Under the Convention and ICARA, district courts\u2019 discre-\ntion to determine whether to return a child where doing so\nwould pose a grave risk to the child includes the discretion\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Saada argues that the approach of other signatory countries, includ-\n\ning the United Kingdom, supports the position that consideration of ame-\nliorative measures is required. See, e.g., In re E, [2011] UKSC 27 \u00b652\n(stating that the focus of the return inquiry should be on the sufficiency\nof protective measures where there are disputed allegations of domestic\nviolence). The Hague Conference on Private International Law\u2019s Guide\nto Good Practice, which the Hague Conference issued to encourage con-\nsistent application of the grave-risk exception internationally, also offers\nsome support for this position, explaining that courts generally should\nconsider \u201cthe circumstances as a whole, including whether adequate\nmeasures of protection are available.\u201d 1980 Child Abduction Convention:\nGuide to Good Practice, Pt. VI, Art. 13(1)(b), p. 31, \u00b641 (2020). The Con-\nvention itself, however, leaves contracting states free to require or not\nrequire consideration of ameliorative measures, and consistent with\nmost signatory countries outside the European Union, see, e.g., Arthur\n& Secretary, Dept. of Family & Community Servs. and Anor, [2017] Fam-\nCAFC 111 \u00b669 (Austl.), Congress has not chosen to require such consid-\neration.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

The Second Circuit\u2019s rule, \u201cin\npractice, rewrite[s] the treaty,\u201d Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez,\n572 U. S. 1, 17 (2014), by imposing an atextual, categorical\nrequirement that courts consider all possible ameliorative\nmeasures in exercising this discretion, regardless of\nwhether such consideration is consistent with the Conven-\ntion\u2019s objectives (and, seemingly, regardless of whether the\nparties offered them for the court\u2019s consideration in the first\nplace). See Blondin I, 189 F. 3d, at 249 (requiring district\ncourt not to \u201climit itself to the single alternative placement\ninitially suggested by [the appellant]\u201d but instead affirma-\ntively to \u201cdevelop a thorough record to facilitate its deci-\nsion,\u201d including by \u201cmak[ing] any appropriate or necessary\ninquiries\u201d of the government of the country of habitual res-\nidence and invoking the aid of the Department of State).\n                                B\n   While consideration of ameliorative measures is within a\ndistrict court\u2019s discretion, \u201c[d]iscretion is not whim.\u201d Mar-\ntin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U. S. 132, 139 (2005). A\n\u201cmotion to a court\u2019s discretion is a motion, not to its inclina-\ntion, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided\nby sound legal principles.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nand alteration omitted). As a threshold matter, a district\ncourt exercising its discretion is still responsible for ad-\ndressing and responding to nonfrivolous arguments timely\nraised by the parties before it. While a district court has no\nobligation under the Convention to consider ameliorative\nmeasures that have not been raised by the parties, it ordi-\nnarily should address ameliorative measures raised by the\nparties or obviously suggested by the circumstances of the\ncase, such as in the example of the localized epidemic. See\nsupra, at 10.\n   In addition, the court\u2019s consideration of ameliorative\nmeasures must be guided by the legal principles and other\n\f12                         GOLAN v. SAADA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirements set forth in the Convention and ICARA. The\nSecond Circuit\u2019s rule, by instructing district courts to order\nreturn \u201cif at all possible,\u201d improperly elevated return above\nthe Convention\u2019s other objectives. Blondin I, 189 F. 3d, at\n248. The Convention does not pursue return exclusively or\nat all costs. Rather, the Convention \u201cis designed to protect\nthe interests of children and their parents,\u201d Lozano, 572\nU. S., at 19 (ALITO, J., concurring), and children\u2019s interests\nmay point against return in some circumstances. Courts\nmust remain conscious of this purpose, as well as the Con-\nvention\u2019s other objectives and requirements, which con-\nstrain courts\u2019 discretion to consider ameliorative measures\nin at least three ways.\n  First, any consideration of ameliorative measures must\nprioritize the child\u2019s physical and psychological safety. The\nConvention explicitly recognizes that the child\u2019s interest in\navoiding physical or psychological harm, in addition to\nother interests, \u201cmay overcome the return remedy.\u201d Id., at\n16 (majority opinion) (cataloging interests).8 A court may\ntherefore decline to consider imposing ameliorative\nmeasures where it is clear that they would not work be-\ncause the risk is so grave. Sexual abuse of a child is one\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The explanatory report for the Convention, which is \u201crecognized by\n\nthe [Hague] Conference as the official history and commentary on the\nConvention and is a source of background on the meaning of the provi-\nsions of the Convention,\u201d supports this understanding. 51 Fed. Reg.\n10503. The explanatory report describes that the general \u201cinterest of the\nchild in not being removed from its habitual residence,\u201d the foundation\nfor the general return principle, \u201cgives way before the primary interest\nof any person in not being exposed to physical or psychological danger or\nbeing placed in an intolerable situation.\u201d 1980 Conf\u00e9rence de La Haye\nde droit international priv\u00e9, Enl\u00e8vement d\u2019enfants, E.

This Court has repeatedly referenced the report in\nHague Convention cases, without \u201cdecid[ing] whether this Report should\nbe given greater weight than a scholarly commentary.\u201d Abbott v. Abbott,\n560 U. S. 1, 19 (2010); see, e.g., Monasky v. Taglieri, 589 U. S. ___, ___,\nn. 2 (2020) (slip op., at 8, n. 2).\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

Other physical or psychological abuse, serious ne-\nglect, and domestic violence in the home may also consti-\ntute an obvious grave risk to the child\u2019s safety that could\nnot readily be ameliorated. A court may also decline to con-\nsider imposing ameliorative measures where it reasonably\nexpects that they will not be followed. See, e.g., Walsh v.\nWalsh, 221 F. 3d 204, 221 (CA1 2000) (providing example\nof parent with history of violating court orders).\n   Second, consideration of ameliorative measures should\nabide by the Convention\u2019s requirement that courts address-\ning return petitions do not usurp the role of the court that\nwill adjudicate the underlying custody dispute. The Con-\nvention and ICARA prohibit courts from resolving any un-\nderlying custody dispute in adjudicating a return petition.\nSee Art. 16, Treaty Doc., at 10; 22 U. S. C. \u00a79001(b)(4). Ac-\ncordingly, a court ordering ameliorative measures in mak-\ning a return determination should limit those measures in\ntime and scope to conditions that would permit safe return,\nwithout purporting to decide subsequent custody matters\nor weighing in on permanent arrangements.9\n   Third, any consideration of ameliorative measures must\naccord with the Convention\u2019s requirement that courts \u201cact\nexpeditiously in proceedings for the return of children.\u201d\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 The Department of State expressed this view in a 1995 letter to a\n\nUnited Kingdom official, emphasizing that any ameliorative measures\nordered to facilitate return \u201cshould be limited in scope and further the\nConvention\u2019s goal of ensuring the prompt return of the child\u201d and that\nmeasures that \u201caddress in great detail issues of custody, visitation, and\nmaintenance\u201d would be \u201cquestionable\u201d given the Convention\u2019s reserva-\ntion of custody issues for resolution in the country of the child\u2019s habitual\nresidence.

SAADA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nArt. 11, Treaty Doc., at 9.10 Timely resolution of return pe-\ntitions is important in part because return is a \u201cprovisional\u201d\nremedy to enable final custody determinations to proceed.\nMonasky, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Convention also prioritizes expedi-\ntious determinations as being in the best interests of the\nchild because \u201c[e]xpedition will help minimize the extent to\nwhich uncertainty adds to the challenges confronting both\nparents and child.\u201d Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U. S. 165, 180\n(2013). A requirement to \u201cexamine the full range of options\nthat might make possible the safe return of a child,\u201d Blon-\ndin II, 238 F. 3d, at 163, n. 11, is in tension with this focus\non expeditious resolution. In this case, for example, it took\nthe District Court nine months to comply with the Second\nCircuit\u2019s directive on remand. Remember, the Convention\nrequires courts to resolve return petitions \u201cus[ing] the most\nexpeditious procedures available,\u201d Art. 2, Treaty Doc., at 7,\nand to provide parties that request it with an explanation\nif proceedings extend longer than six weeks, Art. 11, id., at\n9. Courts should structure return proceedings with these\ninstructions in mind.        Consideration of ameliorative\nmeasures should not cause undue delay in resolution of re-\nturn petitions.\n   To summarize, although nothing in the Convention pro-\nhibits a district court from considering ameliorative\nmeasures, and such consideration often may be appropri-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 Conferring with other countries, when necessary to resolve a peti-\n\ntion, need not take long. The Hague Conference on Private International\nLaw, the intergovernmental organization that adopted the Hague Con-\nvention, has an extensive list of cases and references to practices of vir-\ntually all the signatory countries. Moreover, the Conference has estab-\nlished a network of judges in signatory countries who are available to\nengage in direct judicial communications about the application of the\nConvention.

The court may also find the\ngrave risk so unequivocal, or the potential harm so severe,\nthat ameliorative measures would be inappropriate. Ulti-\nmately, a district court must exercise its discretion to con-\nsider ameliorative measures in a manner consistent with\nits general obligation to address the parties\u2019 substantive ar-\nguments and its specific obligations under the Convention.\nA district court\u2019s compliance with these requirements is\nsubject to review under an ordinary abuse-of-discretion\nstandard.\n                             III\n   The question now becomes how to resolve the instant\ncase. Golan urges that this Court reverse, arguing that the\nameliorative measures adopted by the District Court are in-\nadequate for B. A.

Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 32.\n   Under the circumstances of this case, this Court con-\ncludes that remand is appropriate. The Convention re-\nquires courts to make a discretionary determination as to\nwhether to order return after making a finding of grave\nrisk. The District Court made a finding of grave risk, but\nnever had the opportunity to engage in the discretionary\ninquiry as to whether to order or deny return under the cor-\nrect legal standard. This Court cannot know whether the\nDistrict Court would have exercised its discretion to order\nB. A. S.\u2019 return absent the Second Circuit\u2019s rule, which im-\nproperly weighted the scales in favor of return. Accord-\n\f16                    GOLAN v. SAADA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ningly, it is appropriate to follow the ordinary course and al-\nlow the District Court to apply the proper legal standard in\nthe first instance. Cf. Monasky, 589 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 16\u201317) (declining to follow the \u201c[o]rdinar[y]\u201d course\nof ordering remand where the determination in question\nwas nondiscretionary and there was no \u201creason to antici-\npate that the District Court\u2019s judgment would change on a\nremand\u201d).\n  Remand will as a matter of course add further delay to a\nproceeding that has already spanned years longer than it\nshould have. The delay that has already occurred, however,\ncannot be undone. This Court trusts that the District Court\nwill move as expeditiously as possible to reach a final deci-\nsion without further unnecessary delay. The District Court\nhas ample evidence before it from the prior proceedings and\nhas made extensive factual findings concerning the risks at\nissue. Golan argues that the ameliorative measures or-\ndered intrude too greatly on custodial determinations and\nthat they are inadequate to protect B. A.

Argued March 22, 2022\u2014Decided June 15, 2022\nThe Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Ab-\n  duction requires the judicial or administrative authority of a Contract-\n  ing State to order a child returned to the child\u2019s country of habitual\n  residence if the authority finds that the child has been wrongfully re-\n  moved to or retained in the Contracting State. The authority \u201cis not\n  bound to order the return of the child,\u201d however, if the authority finds\n  that return would expose the child to a \u201cgrave risk\u201d of \u201cphysical or psy-\n  chological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situa-\n  tion.\u201d The International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA) im-\n  plements the Convention in the United States, granting federal and\n  state courts jurisdiction over Convention actions and directing those\n  courts to decide cases in accordance with the Convention.\n     Petitioner Narkis Golan, a United States citizen, married respond-\n  ent Isacco Saada, an Italian citizen, in Italy, where they had a son,\n  B. A. S., in 2016. In 2018, Golan flew with B. A. S. to the United States\n  to attend a wedding and, instead of returning to Italy, moved into a\n  domestic violence shelter with B. A. S. Saada thereafter timely filed a\n  petition with the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of New\n  York, seeking an order returning B. A. S. to Italy pursuant to the\n  Hague Convention. The District Court concluded that B. A. S. would\n  face a grave risk of harm if returned to Italy, given evidence that Saada\n  had abused Golan and that being exposed to this abuse harmfully af-\n  fected B. A. S. The court, however, ordered B. A. S.\u2019 return to Italy, ap-\n  plying Second Circuit precedent obligating it to \u201cexamine the full\n  range of options that might make possible the safe return of a child\u201d\n  and concluding that ameliorative measures could reduce the risk to\n  B. A. S. sufficiently to require his return. The Second Circuit vacated\n  the return order, finding the District Court\u2019s ameliorative measures\n\f2                           GOLAN v. SAADA\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    insufficient. Because the record did not support concluding that no\n    sufficient ameliorative measures existed, the Second Circuit remanded\n    for the District Court to consider whether such measures, in fact, ex-\n    isted. After an examination over nine months, the District Court iden-\n    tified new ameliorative measures and again ordered B. A. S.\u2019 return.\n    The Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A court is not categorically required to examine all possible ame-\n liorative measures before denying a Hague Convention petition for re-\n turn of a child to a foreign country once the court has found that return\n would expose the child to a grave risk of harm.

I. A. S. No.\n11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99\u201311 (Treaty Doc.), if a court\nfinds that a child was wrongfully removed from the child\u2019s\ncountry of habitual residence, the court ordinarily must or-\nder the child\u2019s return. There are, however, exceptions to\nthat rule. As relevant here, a court is not bound to order a\nchild\u2019s return if it finds that return would put the child at a\ngrave risk of physical or psychological harm. In such a cir-\ncumstance, a court has discretion to determine whether to\ndeny return.\n   In exercising this discretion, courts often consider\nwhether any \u201cameliorative measures,\u201d undertaken either\n\u201cby the parents\u201d or \u201cby the authorities of the state having\njurisdiction over the question of custody,\u201d could \u201creduce\nwhatever risk might otherwise be associated with a child\u2019s\nrepatriation.\u201d Blondin v.

Golan soon\nmoved to Milan, and the two wed in August 2015. Their\nson, B. A. S., was born the next summer in Milan, where the\nfamily lived for the first two years of B. A. S.\u2019 life.\n  The following facts, as found by the District Court, are\nnot in dispute. Saada and Golan\u2019s relationship was charac-\nterized by violence from the beginning. The two fought on\nan almost daily basis and, during their arguments, Saada\nwould sometimes push, slap, and grab Golan and pull her\nhair. Saada also yelled and swore at Golan and frequently\ninsulted her and called her names, often in front of other\npeople. Saada once told Golan\u2019s family that he would kill\nher. Much of Saada\u2019s abuse of Golan occurred in front of his\nson.\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

Rather than return as\nscheduled in August, however, Golan moved into a domestic\nviolence shelter with B. A. S. In September, Saada filed in\nItaly a criminal complaint for kidnapping and initiated a\ncivil proceeding seeking sole custody of B. A. S.\n  Saada also filed a petition under the Convention and\nICARA in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District\nof New York, seeking an order for B. A. S.\u2019 return to Italy.\nThe District Court granted Saada\u2019s petition after a 9-day\nbench trial. As a threshold matter, the court determined\nthat Italy was B. A. S.\u2019 habitual residence and that Golan\nhad wrongfully retained B. A. S. in the United States in vi-\nolation of Saada\u2019s rights of custody. The court concluded,\nhowever, that returning B. A. S. to Italy would expose him\nto a grave risk of harm. The court observed that there was\n\u201cno dispute\u201d that Saada was \u201cviolent\u2014physically, psycho-\nlogically, emotionally, and verbally\u2014to\u201d Golan and that \u201cB.\nA. S. was present for much of it.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a.\nThe court described some of the incidents B. A. S. had wit-\nnessed as \u201cchilling.\u201d Ibid. While B. A. S. was not \u201cthe target\nof violence,\u201d undisputed expert testimony established that\n\u201cdomestic violence disrupts a child\u2019s cognitive and social-\nemotional development, and affects the structure and or-\nganization of the child\u2019s brain.\u201d Id., at 79a\u201380a, and n. 37.3\nRecords indicated that Italian social services, who had been\ninvolved with the couple while they lived in Italy, had also\nconcluded that \u201c \u2018the family situation entails a developmen-\ntal danger\u2019 for B. A. S.\u201d Id., at 80a. The court found that\nSaada had demonstrated no \u201ccapacity to change his behav-\nior,\u201d explaining that Saada \u201cminimized or tried to excuse\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The court noted that \u201c[t]here were isolated incidents of possible\n\nabuse\u201d of B. A. S. based on Golan\u2019s testimony that Saada had inadvert-\nently hit and pushed B. A. S. while targeting her and Golan\u2019s brother\u2019s\ntestimony that Saada had spanked B. A. S. aggressively, accusations that\nSaada disputed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a, n. 37; see id., at 54a\u201355a, 61a.\n\f6                          GOLAN v.

The\ncourt concluded that these measures, combined with the\nfact that Saada and Golan would be living separately,\nwould \u201creduce the occasions for violence,\u201d thereby amelio-\nrating the grave risk to B.

The\nDistrict Court directed the parties to appear for status con-\nferences and to submit status reports and supplemental\nbriefs, and the court corresponded with the U. S.

At the\ncourt\u2019s instruction, the parties petitioned the Italian courts\nfor a protective order, and the Italian court overseeing the\nunderlying custody dispute issued a protective order bar-\nring Saada from approaching Golan for one year. In addi-\ntion, the Italian court ordered that an Italian social services\nagency oversee Saada\u2019s parenting classes and therapy and\nthat visits between Saada and B. A.

Under Article 13(b) of the Convention, however, a\ncourt \u201cis not bound to order the return of the child\u201d if the\ncourt finds that the party opposing return has established\nthat return would expose the child to a \u201cgrave risk\u201d of phys-\nical or psychological harm. Id., at 10. By providing that a\ncourt \u201cis not bound\u201d to order return upon making a grave-\nrisk finding, Article 13(b) lifts the Convention\u2019s return re-\nquirement, leaving a court with the discretion to grant or\ndeny return.\n   Nothing in the Convention\u2019s text either forbids or re-\nquires consideration of ameliorative measures in exercising\nthis discretion. The Convention itself nowhere mentions\nameliorative measures. Nor does ICARA, which, as rele-\nvant, instructs courts to \u201cdecide the case in accordance with\nthe Convention\u201d and accordingly leaves undisturbed the\ndiscretion recognized in the Convention. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">22 U.

Essentially, Saada ar-\ngues that determining whether a grave risk of harm exists\nnecessarily requires considering whether any ameliorative\nmeasures are available.\n   The question whether there is a grave risk, however, is\nseparate from the question whether there are ameliorative\n\f10                          GOLAN v. SAADA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nmeasures that could mitigate that risk. That said, the ques-\ntion whether ameliorative measures would be appropriate\nor effective will often overlap considerably with the inquiry\ninto whether a grave risk exists. See Simcox v. Simcox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194852\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194852/simcox-v-simcox/\">511\nF. 3d 594</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607\u2013608 (CA6 2007) (explaining that the appro-\npriateness and utility of ameliorative measures correlate\nwith the gravity of the risk to the child). In many instances,\na court may find it appropriate to consider both questions\nat once. For example, a finding of grave risk as to a part of\na country where an epidemic rages may naturally lead a\ncourt simultaneously to consider whether return to another\npart of the country is feasible. The fact that a court may\nconsider ameliorative measures concurrent with the grave-\nrisk determination, however, does not mean that the Con-\nvention imposes a categorical requirement on a court to con-\nsider any or all ameliorative measures before denying re-\nturn once it finds that a grave risk exists.7\n   Under the Convention and ICARA, district courts\u2019 discre-\ntion to determine whether to return a child where doing so\nwould pose a grave risk to the child includes the discretion\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Saada argues that the approach of other signatory countries, includ-\n\ning the United Kingdom, supports the position that consideration of ame-\nliorative measures is required. See, e.g., In re E, [2011] UKSC 27 \u00b652\n(stating that the focus of the return inquiry should be on the sufficiency\nof protective measures where there are disputed allegations of domestic\nviolence). The Hague Conference on Private International Law\u2019s Guide\nto Good Practice, which the Hague Conference issued to encourage con-\nsistent application of the grave-risk exception internationally, also offers\nsome support for this position, explaining that courts generally should\nconsider \u201cthe circumstances as a whole, including whether adequate\nmeasures of protection are available.\u201d 1980 Child Abduction Convention:\nGuide to Good Practice, Pt. VI, Art. 13(1)(b), p. 31, \u00b641 (2020). The Con-\nvention itself, however, leaves contracting states free to require or not\nrequire consideration of ameliorative measures, and consistent with\nmost signatory countries outside the European Union, see, e.g., Arthur\n& Secretary, Dept. of Family & Community Servs. and Anor, [2017] Fam-\nCAFC 111 \u00b669 (Austl.), Congress has not chosen to require such consid-\neration.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

The Convention does not pursue return exclusively or\nat all costs. Rather, the Convention \u201cis designed to protect\nthe interests of children and their parents,\u201d Lozano, 572\nU.

Courts\nmust remain conscious of this purpose, as well as the Con-\nvention\u2019s other objectives and requirements, which con-\nstrain courts\u2019 discretion to consider ameliorative measures\nin at least three ways.\n  First, any consideration of ameliorative measures must\nprioritize the child\u2019s physical and psychological safety.

In this case, for example, it took\nthe District Court nine months to comply with the Second\nCircuit\u2019s directive on remand.

The Hague Conference on Private International\nLaw, the intergovernmental organization that adopted the Hague Con-\nvention, has an extensive list of cases and references to practices of vir-\ntually all the signatory countries.

The court may also find the\ngrave risk so unequivocal, or the potential harm so severe,\nthat ameliorative measures would be inappropriate. Ulti-\nmately, a district court must exercise its discretion to con-\nsider ameliorative measures in a manner consistent with\nits general obligation to address the parties\u2019 substantive ar-\nguments and its specific obligations under the Convention.\nA district court\u2019s compliance with these requirements is\nsubject to review under an ordinary abuse-of-discretion\nstandard.\n                             III\n   The question now becomes how to resolve the instant\ncase.

Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 32.\n   Under the circumstances of this case, this Court con-\ncludes that remand is appropriate. The Convention re-\nquires courts to make a discretionary determination as to\nwhether to order return after making a finding of grave\nrisk. The District Court made a finding of grave risk, but\nnever had the opportunity to engage in the discretionary\ninquiry as to whether to order or deny return under the cor-\nrect legal standard. This Court cannot know whether the\nDistrict Court would have exercised its discretion to order\nB. A. S.\u2019 return absent the Second Circuit\u2019s rule, which im-\nproperly weighted the scales in favor of return. Accord-\n\f16                    GOLAN v.

She also asserted a wide array of other violations allegedly sus-\n  tained by other Viking employees. Moriana\u2019s employment contract\n  with Viking contained a mandatory arbitration agreement. Important\n  here, that agreement contained both a \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d\u2014provid-\n  ing that the parties could not bring any dispute as a class, collective,\n  or representative action under PAGA\u2014and a severability clause\u2014\n\f2             VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v. MORIANA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    specifying that if the waiver was found invalid, such a dispute would\n    presumptively be litigated in court. Under the severability clause, any\n    \u201cportion\u201d of the waiver that remained valid would be \u201cenforced in arbi-\n    tration.\u201d Viking moved to compel arbitration of Moriana\u2019s individual\n    PAGA claim and to dismiss her other PAGA claims. Applying Califor-\n    nia\u2019s Iskanian precedent, the California courts denied that motion,\n    holding that categorical waivers of PAGA standing are contrary to Cal-\n    ifornia policy and that PAGA claims cannot be split into arbitrable \u201cin-\n    dividual\u201d claims and nonarbitrable \u201crepresentative\u201d claims. This\n    Court granted certiorari to decide whether the FAA preempts the Cal-\n    ifornia rule.\nHeld: The FAA preempts the rule of Iskanian insofar as it precludes di-\n vision of PAGA actions into individual and non-individual claims\n through an agreement to arbitrate. Pp. 7\u201321.\n    (a) Based on the principle that \u201c[a]rbitration is strictly \u2018a matter of\n consent,\u2019 \u201d Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U. S. 287, 299, this Court\n has held that \u201ca party may not be compelled under the FAA to submit\n to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding\n that the party agreed to do so,\u201d Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l\n Corp., 559 U. S. 662, 684. Because class-action arbitration mandates\n procedural changes that are inconsistent with the individualized and\n informal mode of bilateral arbitration contemplated by the FAA, see\n AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U. S. 333, 347, class proce-\n dures cannot be imposed by state law without presenting unwilling\n parties with an unacceptable choice between being compelled to arbi-\n trate using such procedures and forgoing arbitration all together.\n Viking contends that the Court\u2019s FAA precedents require enforcement\n of contractual provisions waiving the right to bring PAGA actions be-\n cause PAGA creates a form of class or collective proceeding. If this is\n correct, Iskanian\u2019s prohibition on PAGA waivers presents parties with\n an impermissible choice: Either arbitrate disputes using a form of class\n procedures, or do not arbitrate at all. Moriana maintains that any\n conflict between Iskanian and the FAA is illusory because PAGA cre-\n ates nothing more than a substantive cause of action.\n    This Court disagrees with both characterizations of the statute. Mo-\n riana\u2019s premise that PAGA creates a unitary private cause of action is\n irreconcilable with the structure of the statute and the ordinary legal\n meaning of the word \u201cclaim.\u201d A PAGA action asserting multiple viola-\n tions under California\u2019s Labor Code affecting a range of different em-\n ployees does not constitute \u201ca single claim\u201d in even the broadest possi-\n ble sense. Viking\u2019s position, on the other hand, elides important\n structural differences between PAGA actions and class actions. A\n class-action plaintiff can raise a multitude of claims because he or she\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nrepresents a multitude of absent individuals; a PAGA plaintiff, by con-\ntrast, represents a single principal, the LWDA, that has a multitude\nof claims. As a result, PAGA suits exhibit virtually none of the proce-\ndural characteristics of class actions.\n   This Court\u2019s FAA precedents treat bilateral arbitration as the pro-\ntotype of the individualized and informal form of arbitration protected\nfrom undue state interference by the FAA. See, e.g., Epic Systems\nCorp. v. Lewis, 584 U. S. ___, ___. Viking posits that a proceeding is\n\u201cbilateral\u201d only if it involves two and only two parties and \u201cis conducted\nby and on behalf of the individual named parties only.\u201d Wal-Mart\nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. 338, 348. Thus, Iskanian\u2019s prohibition\non PAGA waivers is inconsistent with the FAA because PAGA creates\nan intrinsically representational form of action and Iskanian requires\nparties either to arbitrate in that format or forgo arbitration alto-\ngether.\n   This Court disagrees. Nothing in the FAA establishes a categorical\nrule mandating enforcement of waivers of standing to assert claims on\nbehalf of absent principals. Non-class representative actions in which\na single agent litigates on behalf of a single principal necessarily devi-\nate from the strict ideal of bilateral dispute resolution posited by Vi-\nking, but this Court has never held that the FAA imposes a duty on\nStates to render all forms of representative standing waivable by con-\ntract or that such suits deviate from the norm of bilateral arbitration.\nUnlike procedures distinctive to multiparty litigation, single-principal,\nsingle-agent representative actions are \u201cbilateral\u201d in two registers:\nThey involve the rights of only the absent real party in interest and\nthe defendant, and litigation need only be conducted by the agent-\nplaintiff and the defendant. Nothing in this Court\u2019s precedent sug-\ngests that in enacting the FAA, Congress intended to require States to\nreshape their agency law governing who can assert claims on behalf of\nwhom to ensure that parties will never have to arbitrate disputes in a\nproceeding that deviates from bilateral arbitration in the strictest\nsense. Pp. 7\u201317.\n   (b) PAGA\u2019s built-in mechanism of claim joinder is in conflict with the\nFAA. Iskanian\u2019s prohibition on contractual division of PAGA actions\ninto constituent claims unduly circumscribes the freedom of parties to\ndetermine \u201cthe issues subject to arbitration\u201d and \u201cthe rules by which\nthey will arbitrate,\u201d Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, 587 U. S. ____, ____,\nand does so in a way that violates the fundamental principle that \u201car-\nbitration is a matter of consent,\u201d Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at 684. For\nthat reason, state law cannot condition the enforceability of an agree-\nment to arbitrate on the availability of a procedural mechanism that\nwould permit a party to expand the scope of the anticipated arbitration\nby introducing claims that the parties did not jointly agree to arbitrate.\n\f4              VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v. MORIANA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    A state rule imposing an expansive rule of joinder in the arbitral con-\n    text would defeat the ability of parties to control which claims are sub-\n    ject to arbitration by permitting parties to superadd new claims to the\n    proceeding, regardless of whether the agreement committed those\n    claims to arbitration. When made compulsory by way of Iskanian,\n    PAGA\u2019s joinder rule functions in exactly this way. The effect is to co-\n    erce parties into withholding PAGA claims from arbitration. Is-\n    kanian\u2019s indivisibility rule effectively coerces parties to opt for a judi-\n    cial forum rather than \u201cforgo[ing] the procedural rigor and appellate\n    review of the courts to realize the benefits of private dispute resolu-\n    tion.\u201d Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at 685. Pp. 17\u201319.\n       (c) Under this Courts holding, Iskanian\u2019s prohibition on wholesale\n    waivers of PAGA claims is not preempted by the FAA. But Iskanian\u2019s\n    rule that PAGA actions cannot be divided into individual and non-in-\n    dividual claims is preempted, so Viking was entitled to compel arbi-\n    tration of Moriana\u2019s individual claim. PAGA provides no mechanism\n    to enable a court to adjudicate non-individual PAGA claims once an\n    individual claim has been committed to a separate proceeding. And\n    under PAGA\u2019s standing requirement, a plaintiff has standing to main-\n    tain non-individual PAGA claims in an action only by virtue of also\n    maintaining an individual claim in that action. As a result, Moriana\n    would lack statutory standing to maintain her non-individual claims\n    in court, and the correct course was to dismiss her remaining claims.\n    Pp. 20\u201321.\nReversed and remanded.\n\n   ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BREYER, SO-\nTOMAYOR,    KAGAN, and GORSUCH, JJ., joined, in which ROBERTS, C.

S. C. \u00a71 et seq.,\npreempts a rule of California law that invalidates contrac-\ntual waivers of the right to assert representative claims un-\nder California\u2019s Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act\nof 2004. Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \u00a72698 et seq. (West 2022).\n                              I\n                             A\n  The California Legislature enacted the Labor Code Pri-\nvate Attorneys General Act (PAGA) to address a perceived\ndeficit in the enforcement of the State\u2019s Labor Code. Cali-\nfornia\u2019s Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA)\nhad the authority to bring enforcement actions to impose\ncivil penalties on employers for violations of many of the\ncode\u2019s provisions. But the legislature believed the LWDA\ndid not have sufficient resources to reach the appropriate\nlevel of compliance, and budgetary constraints made it im-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n *THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins Parts I and III of this opinion.\n\f2            VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v. MORIANA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npossible to achieve an adequate level of financing. The leg-\nislature thus decided to enlist employees as private attor-\nneys general to enforce California labor law, with the un-\nderstanding that labor-law enforcement agencies were to\nretain primacy over private enforcement efforts.\n   By its terms, PAGA authorizes any \u201caggrieved employee\u201d\nto initiate an action against a former employer \u201con behalf of\nhimself or herself and other current or former employees\u201d\nto obtain civil penalties that previously could have been re-\ncovered only by the State in an LWDA enforcement action.\nCal. Lab. Code Ann. \u00a72699(a). As the text of the statute\nindicates, PAGA limits statutory standing to \u201caggrieved\nemployees\u201d\u2014a term defined to include \u201cany person who was\nemployed by the alleged violator and against whom one or\nmore of the alleged violations was committed.\u201d \u00a72699(c). To\nbring suit, however, an employee must also exhaust admin-\nistrative remedies. That entails providing notice to the em-\nployer and the LWDA of the violations alleged and the sup-\nporting facts and theories. \u00a72699.3(a)(1)(A). If the LWDA\nfails to respond or initiate an investigation within a speci-\nfied timeframe, the employee may bring suit. \u00a72699.3(a)(2).\nIn any successful PAGA action, the LWDA is entitled to 75\npercent of the award. \u00a72699(i). The remaining 25 percent\nis distributed among the employees affected by the viola-\ntions at issue. Ibid.\n   California law characterizes PAGA as creating a \u201ctype of\nqui tam action,\u201d1 Iskanian v. CLS Transp.

Alt-\nhough the statute\u2019s language suggests that an \u201caggrieved\nemployee\u201d sues \u201con behalf of himself or herself and other\ncurrent or former employees,\u201d \u00a72699(a), California prece-\ndent holds that a PAGA suit is a \u201c \u2018representative action\u2019 \u201d\nin which the employee plaintiff sues as an \u201c \u2018agent or proxy\u2019 \u201d\nof the State. Id., at 380, 327 P. 3d, at 147 (quoting Arias v.\nSuperior Court, 46 Cal. 4th 969, 986, 209 P. 3d 923, 933\n(2009)).\n   As the California courts conceive of it, the State \u201cis al-\nways the real party in interest in the suit.\u201d Iskanian, 59\nCal. 4th, at 382, 327 P. 3d, at 148.2 The primary function\nof PAGA is to delegate a power to employees to assert \u201cthe\nsame legal right and interest as state law enforcement\nagencies,\u201d Arias, 46 Cal. 4th, at 986, 209 P. 3d, at 933. In\nother words, the statute gives employees a right to assert\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The extent to which PAGA plaintiffs truly act as agents of the State\n\nrather than complete assignees is disputed. See Magadia v. Wal-Mart\nAssocs., Inc., 999 F. 3d 668, 677 (CA9 2021) (holding that PAGA \u201clacks\nthe procedural controls necessary to ensure that California\u201d retains \u201csub-\nstantial authority over the case\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nAgency requires control. See Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U. S. 693, 713\n(2013). But apart from the exhaustion process, the statute does not fea-\nture any explicit control mechanisms, such as provisions authorizing the\nState to intervene or requiring its approval of settlements.\n  That said, California precedent strongly suggests that the State re-\ntains inherent authority to manage PAGA actions. There is no other ob-\nvious way to understand California precedent\u2019s description of the State\nas the \u201creal party in interest.\u201d See generally 1A Cal. Jur. 3d Actions \u00a731\n(real-party-in-interest status is based on ownership and control over the\ncause of action). And a theory of total assignment appears inconsistent\nwith the fact that employees have no assignable interest in a PAGA\nclaim. See Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Supe-\nrior Court of Los Angeles Cty., 46 Cal. 4th 993, 1002, 209 P. 3d 937, 943\n(2009) (Amalgamated Transit); see also Turrieta v. Lyft, Inc., 69 Cal.\nApp. 5th 955, 972, 284 Cal.

Iskanian, 59 Cal. 4th, at 381, 327 P. 3d, at\n148; see also Amalgamated Transit, 46 Cal. 4th 993, 1002,\n209 P. 3d 937, 943 (2009). The code provisions enforced\nthrough the statute establish public duties that are owed to\nthe State, not private rights belonging to employees in their\n\u201cindividual capacities.\u201d Iskanian, 59 Cal. 4th, at 381, 327\nP. 3d, at 147. Other, distinct provisions of the code create\nindividual rights, and claims arising from violations of\nthose rights are actionable through separate private causes\nof action for compensatory or statutory damages. Id., at\n381\u2013382, 327 P. 3d, at 147\u2013148; see also Kim v. Reins Int\u2019l\nCalifornia, Inc., 9 Cal. 5th 73, 86, 459 P. 3d 1123, 1130\n(2020) (\u201c[C]ivil penalties recovered on the state\u2019s behalf are\nintended to remediate present violations and deter future\nones, not to redress employees\u2019 injuries\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted; emphasis deleted)). And because PAGA ac-\ntions are understood to involve the assertion of the govern-\nment\u2019s claims on a derivative basis, the judgment issued in\na PAGA action is binding on anyone \u201cwho would be bound\nby a judgment in an action brought by the government.\u201d\nArias, 46 Cal. 4th, at 986, 209 P. 3d, at 933.\n   California precedent also interprets the statute to con-\ntain what is effectively a rule of claim joinder. Rules of\nclaim joinder allow a party to unite multiple claims against\nan opposing party in a single action. See 6A C. Wright, H.\nMiller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71582\n(3d ed. 2016) (Wright & Miller). PAGA standing has the\nsame function. An employee with statutory standing may\n\u201cseek any civil penalties the state can, including penalties\nfor violations involving employees other than the PAGA lit-\nigant herself.\u201d ZB, N. A. v. Superior Court, 8 Cal. 5th 175,\n185, 448 P. 3d 239, 243\u2013244 (2019). An employee who al-\nleges he or she suffered a single violation is entitled to use\nthat violation as a gateway to assert a potentially limitless\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnumber of other violations as predicates for liability. This\nmechanism radically expands the scope of PAGA actions.\nThe default penalties set by PAGA are $100 for each ag-\ngrieved employee per pay period for the initial violation and\n$200 for each aggrieved employee per pay period for each\nsubsequent violation. Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \u00a72699(f )(2). In-\ndividually, these penalties are modest; but given PAGA\u2019s\nadditive dimension, low-value claims may easily be welded\ntogether into high-value suits.\n                              B\n  Petitioner Viking River Cruises, Inc. (Viking), is a com-\npany that offers ocean and river cruises around the world.\nWhen respondent Angie Moriana was hired by Viking as a\nsales representative, she executed an agreement to arbi-\ntrate any dispute arising out of her employment. The\nagreement contained a \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d providing\nthat in any arbitral proceeding, the parties could not bring\nany dispute as a class, collective, or representative PAGA\naction. It also contained a severability clause specifying\nthat if the waiver was found invalid, any class, collective,\nrepresentative, or PAGA action would presumptively be lit-\nigated in court. But under that severability clause, if any\n\u201cportion\u201d of the waiver remained valid, it would be \u201cen-\nforced in arbitration.\u201d\n  After leaving her position with Viking, Moriana filed a\nPAGA action against Viking in California court. Her com-\nplaint contained a claim that Viking had failed to provide\nher with her final wages within 72 hours, as required by\n\u00a7\u00a7101\u2013102 of the California Labor Code. But the complaint\nalso asserted a wide array of other code violations allegedly\nsustained by other Viking employees, including violations\nof provisions concerning the minimum wage, overtime,\nmeal periods, rest periods, timing of pay, and pay state-\nments. Viking moved to compel arbitration of Moriana\u2019s\n\u201cindividual\u201d PAGA claim\u2014here meaning the claim that\n\f6          VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v. MORIANA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\narose from the violation she suffered\u2014and to dismiss her\nother PAGA claims. The trial court denied that motion, and\nthe California Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that cate-\ngorical waivers of PAGA standing are contrary to state pol-\nicy and that PAGA claims cannot be split into arbitrable\nindividual claims and nonarbitrable \u201crepresentative\u201d\nclaims.\n   This ruling was dictated by the California Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Iskanian. In that case, the court held\nthat pre-dispute agreements to waive the right to bring\n\u201crepresentative\u201d PAGA claims are invalid as a matter of\npublic policy. What, precisely, this holding means requires\nsome explanation. PAGA\u2019s unique features have prompted\nthe development of an entire vocabulary unique to the stat-\nute, but the details, it seems, are still being worked out. An\nunfortunate feature of this lexicon is that it tends to use the\nword \u201crepresentative\u201d in two distinct ways, and each of\nthose uses of the term \u201crepresentative\u201d is connected with\none of Iskanian\u2019s rules governing contractual waiver of\nPAGA claims.\n   In the first sense, PAGA actions are \u201crepresentative\u201d in\nthat they are brought by employees acting as representa-\ntives\u2014that is, as agents or proxies\u2014of the State.

But Iskanian\nalso adopted a secondary rule that invalidates agreements\nto separately arbitrate or litigate \u201cindividual PAGA claims\nfor Labor Code violations that an employee suffered,\u201d on the\ntheory that resolving victim-specific claims in separate ar-\nbitrations does not serve the deterrent purpose of PAGA.\n59 Cal. 4th, at 383, 327 P. 3d, at 149; see also Kim, 9 Cal.\n5th, at 88, 459 P. 3d, at 1132 (noting that based on Is-\nkanian, California courts have uniformly \u201crejected efforts to\nsplit PAGA claims into individual and representative com-\nponents\u201d).\n   In this case, Iskanian\u2019s principal prohibition required the\nlower courts to treat the representative-action waiver in the\nagreement between Moriana and Viking as invalid insofar\nas it was construed as a wholesale waiver of PAGA stand-\ning. The agreement\u2019s severability clause, however, allowed\nenforcement of any \u201cportion\u201d of the waiver that remained\nvalid, so the agreement still would have permitted arbitra-\ntion of Moriana\u2019s individual PAGA claim even if wholesale\nenforcement was impossible.

These clauses\njointly establish \u201can equal-treatment principle: A court may\ninvalidate an arbitration agreement based on \u2018generally ap-\nplicable contract defenses\u2019 like fraud or unconscionability,\nbut not on legal rules that \u2018apply only to arbitration or that\nderive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to ar-\nbitrate is at issue.\u2019 \u201d Kindred Nursing Centers L.

Under that principle, the FAA \u201cpreempts any state\nrule discriminating on its face against arbitration\u2014for ex-\nample, a law \u2018prohibit[ing] outright the arbitration of a par-\nticular type of claim.\u2019 \u201d Kindred Nursing, 581 U.

S. 333, 342 (2011) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Two important devices were the doctrines of ouster and revocabil-\nity, which, respectively, invalidated arbitration clauses as impermissible\nattempts to \u201coust\u201d courts of their jurisdiction and permitted parties to\nrevoke consent to arbitrate until the moment the arbitrator entered an\naward. See, e.g., Kill v. Hollister, 1 Wils. K. B. 129, 95 Eng. Rep. 532\n(K. B. 1746); Vynior\u2019s Case, 77 Co. Rep. 80a, 77 Eng. Rep. 597 (K. B.\n1609). Another was the rule barring specific performance as a remedy\nfor breach of an arbitration clause. See 21 R. Lord, Williston on Con-\ntracts \u00a757:2 (4th ed. 2017). Section 2 abrogated these doctrines by mak-\ning arbitration agreements presumptively \u201cvalid,\u201d \u201cirrevocable,\u201d and \u201cen-\nforceable.\u201d\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

As a result, class procedures\ncannot be imposed by state law without presenting unwill-\ning parties with an unacceptable choice between being com-\npelled to arbitrate using procedures at odds with arbitra-\ntion\u2019s traditional form and forgoing arbitration altogether.\nPutting parties to that choice is inconsistent with the FAA.\n\f10           VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v. MORIANA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Viking contends that these decisions require enforcement\nof contractual provisions waiving the right to bring PAGA\nactions because PAGA creates a form of class or collective\nproceeding. If this is correct, Iskanian\u2019s prohibition on\nPAGA waivers presents parties with the same impermissi-\nble choice as the rules we have invalidated in our decisions\nconcerning class- and collective-action waivers: Either arbi-\ntrate disputes using a form of class procedure, or do not ar-\nbitrate at all.\n  Moriana offers a very different characterization of the\nstatute. As she sees it, any conflict between Iskanian and\nthe FAA is illusory because PAGA creates nothing more\nthan a substantive cause of action. The only thing that is\ndistinctive about PAGA, she supposes, is that it allows em-\nployee plaintiffs to increase the available penalties that\nmay be awarded in an action by proving additional predi-\ncate violations of the Labor Code. But that does not make\na PAGA action a class action, because those violations are\nnot distinct claims belonging to distinct individuals. In-\nstead, they are predicates for expanded liability under a\nsingle cause of action. In Moriana\u2019s view, that means Is-\nkanian invalidates waivers of substantive rights, and does\nnot purport to invalidate anything that can meaningfully\nbe described as an \u201carbitration agreement.\u201d4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Moriana declines to defend one of the Iskanian court\u2019s own bases for\n\nholding that the FAA does not mandate enforcement of PAGA waivers.\nThe Iskanian court reasoned that a PAGA action lies outside the FAA\u2019s\ncoverage entirely because \u00a72 is limited to controversies \u201carising out of \u201d\nthe contract between the parties, 9 U. S. C. \u00a72 (emphasis added), and a\nPAGA action \u201cis not a dispute between an employer and an employee\narising out of their contractual relationship,\u201d but \u201ca dispute between an\nemployer and the state.\u201d Iskanian v. CLS Transp. Los Angeles, LLC, 59\nCal. 4th 348, 387, 327 P. 3d 129, 151 (2014). We reject this argument.\nAlthough the terms of \u00a72 limit the FAA\u2019s enforcement mandate to agree-\nments to arbitrate controversies that \u201carise out of \u201d the parties\u2019 contrac-\ntual relationship, disputes resolved in PAGA actions satisfy this require-\nment. The contractual relationship between the parties is a but-for cause\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                     11\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   We disagree with both characterizations of the statute.\nMoriana is correct that the FAA does not require courts to\nenforce contractual waivers of substantive rights and rem-\nedies. The FAA\u2019s mandate is to enforce \u201carbitration agree-\nments.\u201d Concepcion, 563 U. S., at 344 (emphasis added).\nAnd as we have described it, an arbitration agreement is \u201ca\nspecialized kind of forum-selection clause that posits not\nonly the situs of suit but also the procedure to be used in\nresolving the dispute.\u201d Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417\nU. S. 506, 519 (1974); Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\nChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 633 (1985). An ar-\nbitration agreement thus does not alter or abridge substan-\ntive rights; it merely changes how those rights will be pro-\ncessed. And so we have said that \u201c \u2018[b]y agreeing to\narbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the sub-\nstantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to\ntheir resolution in an arbitral . . . forum.\u2019 \u201d Preston v. Fer-\nrer, 552 U. S. 346, 359 (2008) (quoting Mitsubishi Motors\nCorp., 473 U. S., at 628).5\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nof any justiciable legal controversy between the parties under PAGA, and\n\u201carising out of \u201d language normally refers to a causal relationship. See,\ne.g., Ford Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, 592 U. S.\n___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 8). And regardless of whether a PAGA action\nis in some sense also a dispute between an employer and the State, noth-\ning in the FAA categorically exempts claims belonging to sovereigns from\nthe scope of \u00a72.\n   5 In briefing before this Court, Viking argued that the principle that\n\nthe FAA does not mandate enforcement of provisions waiving substan-\ntive rights is limited to federal statutes. This argument is erroneous.\nThe basis of this principle is not anything unique about federal statutes.\nIt is that the FAA requires only the enforcement of \u201cprovision[s]\u201d to settle\na controversy \u201cby arbitration,\u201d \u00a72, and not any provision that happens to\nappear in a contract that features an arbitration clause. That is why we\nmentioned this principle in Preston, which concerned claims arising un-\nder state law. See 552 U. S., at 360 (noting that under the agreement, a\nparty \u201crelinquishe[d] no substantive rights . . . California law may accord\nhim\u201d).\n\f12           VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v. MORIANA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   But Moriana\u2019s premise that PAGA creates a unitary pri-\nvate cause of action is irreconcilable with the structure of\nthe statute and the ordinary legal meaning of the word\n\u201cclaim.\u201d California courts interpret PAGA to provide em-\nployees with delegated authority to assert the State\u2019s\nclaims on a representative basis, not an individual cause of\naction. See, e.g., Amalgamated Transit, 46 Cal. 4th, at\n1003, 209 P. 3d, at 943 (PAGA \u201cis simply a procedural stat-\nute\u201d that \u201cdoes not create property rights or any other sub-\nstantive rights\u201d). And a PAGA action asserting multiple\ncode violations affecting a range of different employees does\nnot constitute \u201ca single claim\u201d in even the broadest possible\nsense, because the violations asserted need not even arise\nfrom a common \u201ctransaction\u201d or \u201cnucleus of operative facts.\u201d\nLucky Brand Dungarees, Inc. v. Marcel Fashions Group,\nInc., 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 6) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted).6\n   Viking\u2019s position, on the other hand, elides important\nstructural differences between PAGA actions and class ac-\ntions that preclude any straightforward application of our\nprecedents invalidating prohibitions on class-action waiv-\ners. Class-action procedure allows courts to use a repre-\nsentative plaintiff \u2019s individual claims as a basis to \u201cadjudi-\ncate claims of multiple parties at once, instead of in\nseparate suits,\u201d Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A. v.\nAllstate Ins. Co., 559 U. S. 393, 408 (2010). This, of course,\nrequires the certification of a class. And because class judg-\nments bind absentees with respect to their individual\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 California courts sometimes speak as though a PAGA action involves\n\nthe assertion of \u201ca single representative PAGA claim,\u201d Williams v. Supe-\nrior Court, 237 Cal. App. 4th 642, 649, 188 Cal. Rptr. 3d 83, 87 (2015).\nBut we are not required to take the labels affixed by state courts at face\nvalue in determining whether state law creates a scheme at odds with\nfederal law. See, e.g., Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363, 367\u2013368 (1930).\nAnd in our view, this manner of speaking is another reflection of the still-\nembryonic character of the language that has grown up around PAGA.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclaims for relief and are preclusive as to all claims the class\ncould have brought, Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Rich-\nmond, 467 U. S. 867, 874 (1984), \u201cclass representatives\nmust at all times adequately represent absent class mem-\nbers, and absent [class] members must be afforded notice,\nan opportunity to be heard, and a right to opt out of the\nclass.\u201d Concepcion, 563 U.

And to \u201censur[e] that\nthe named plaintiffs are appropriate representatives of the\nclass whose claims they wish to litigate,\u201d the adjudicator\nmust decide questions of numerosity, commonality, typical-\nity, and adequacy of representation. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\nv. Dukes, 564 U. S. 338, 349 (2011).\n   PAGA actions also permit the adjudication of multiple\nclaims in a single suit, but their structure is entirely differ-\nent. A class-action plaintiff can raise a multitude of claims\nbecause he or she represents a multitude of absent individ-\nuals; a PAGA plaintiff, by contrast, represents a single prin-\ncipal, the LWDA, that has a multitude of claims. As a result\nof this structural difference, PAGA suits exhibit virtually\nnone of the procedural characteristics of class actions. The\nplaintiff does not represent a class of injured individuals, so\nthere is no need for certification. PAGA judgments are\nbinding only with respect to the State\u2019s claims, and are not\nbinding on nonparty employees as to any individually held\nclaims. Arias, 46 Cal. 4th, at 986, 209 P. 3d, at 933\u2013934.\nThis obviates the need to consider adequacy of representa-\ntion, numerosity, commonality, or typicality. And although\nthe statute gives other affected employees a future interest\nin the penalties awarded in an action, that interest does not\nmake those employees \u201cparties\u201d in any of the senses in\nwhich absent class members are, see Devlin v. Scardelletti,\n536 U. S. 1 (2002), or give those employees anything more\nthan an inchoate interest in litigation proceeds. See Ver-\nmont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel.\nStevens, 529 U. S. 765, 773 (2000) (The \u201c \u2018right\u2019 \u201d to a share\n\f14         VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v.

See Concep-\ncion, 563 U. S., at 347\u2013348. Of course, as a practical matter,\nPAGA actions do have something important in common\nwith class actions. Because PAGA plaintiffs represent a\nprincipal with a potentially vast number of claims at its dis-\nposal, PAGA suits \u201cgreatly increas[e] risks to defendants.\u201d\nId., at 350. But our precedents do not hold that the FAA\nallows parties to contract out of anything that might am-\nplify defense risks. Instead, our cases hold that States can-\nnot coerce individuals into forgoing arbitration by taking\nthe individualized and informal procedures characteristic of\ntraditional arbitration off the table. Litigation risks are rel-\nevant to that inquiry because one way in which state law\nmay coerce parties into forgoing their right to arbitrate is\nby conditioning that right on the use of a procedural format\nthat makes arbitration artificially unattractive. The ques-\ntion, then, is whether PAGA contains any procedural mech-\nanism at odds with arbitration\u2019s basic form.\n   Viking suggests an answer. Our FAA precedents treat\nbilateral arbitration as the prototype of the individualized\nand informal form of arbitration protected from undue state\ninterference by the FAA. See Epic Systems, 584 U. S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8\u20139); see also American Express Co. v.\nItalian Colors Restaurant, 570 U. S. 228, 238 (2013); Con-\ncepcion, 563 U. S., at 347\u2013349; Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at\n685\u2013686. Viking posits that a proceeding is \u201cbilateral\u201d in\nthe relevant sense if\u2014but only if\u2014it involves two and only\ntwo parties and the arbitration \u201c \u2018is conducted by and on be-\nhalf of the individual named parties only.\u2019 \u201d Wal-Mart, 564\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

PAGA actions necessarily deviate from\nthis ideal because they involve litigation or arbitration on\nbehalf of an absent principal. Viking thus suggests that\nIskanian\u2019s prohibition on PAGA waivers is inconsistent\nwith the FAA because PAGA creates an intrinsically repre-\nsentational form of action and Iskanian requires parties ei-\nther to arbitrate in that format or forgo arbitration alto-\ngether.\n   We disagree. Nothing in the FAA establishes a categori-\ncal rule mandating enforcement of waivers of standing to\nassert claims on behalf of absent principals. Non-class rep-\nresentative actions in which a single agent litigates on be-\nhalf of a single principal are part of the basic architecture\nof much of substantive law. Familiar examples include\nshareholder-derivative suits, wrongful-death actions, trus-\ntee actions, and suits on behalf of infants or incompetent\npersons. Single-agent, single-principal suits of this kind\nnecessarily deviate from the strict ideal of bilateral dispute\nresolution posited by Viking. But we have never held that\nthe FAA imposes a duty on States to render all forms of rep-\nresentative standing waivable by contract. Nor have we\nsuggested that single-agent, single-principal representa-\ntive suits are inconsistent the norm of bilateral arbitration\nas our precedents conceive of it. Instead, we have held that\n\u201cthe \u2018changes brought about by the shift from bilateral ar-\nbitration to class-action arbitration\u2019 \u201d are too fundamental\nto be imposed on parties without their consent. Concepcion,\n563 U. S., at 347\u2013348 (quoting Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at\n686; emphasis added).

Requir-\ning parties to decide whether to arbitrate or litigate a\nsingle-agent, single-principal action does not produce a\nshift from a situation in which the arbitrator must \u201cre-\nsolv[e] a single dispute between the parties to a single\nagreement\u201d to one in which he or she must \u201cresolv[e] many\ndisputes between hundreds or perhaps even thousands of\nparties.\u201d Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at 686. And a proceeding\nin which two and only two parties arbitrate exclusively in\ntheir individual capacities is not the only thing one might\nmean by \u201cbilateral arbitration.\u201d As we have said, \u201c[t]he la-\nbel \u2018party\u2019 does not indicate an absolute characteristic, but\nrather a conclusion about the applicability of various proce-\ndural rules that may differ based on context.\u201d Devlin, 536\nU.

Our precedents use the phrase \u201cbilateral arbi-\ntration\u201d in opposition to \u201cclass or collective\u201d arbitration, and\nthe problems we have identified in mandatory class arbitra-\ntion arise from procedures characteristic of multiparty rep-\nresentative actions.

Unlike these kinds of actions, single-principal,\nsingle-agent representative actions are \u201cbilateral\u201d in two\nregisters: They involve the rights of only the absent real\nparty in interest and the defendant, and litigation need only\nbe conducted by the agent-plaintiff and the defendant. This\ndegree of deviation from bilateral norms is not alien to tra-\nditional arbitral practice,7 and our precedents have never\nsuggested otherwise. See, e.g., Marmet Health Care Center,\nInc. v. Brown, 565 U. S. 530 (2012) (per curiam) (invalidat-\ning rule categorically barring arbitration of wrongful-death\nactions).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 For example, close corporations have included arbitration clauses in\n\nnegotiated shareholder agreements for many decades. See, e.g., In re\nCarl, 263 App. Div. 887, 32 N. Y. S. 2d 410 (1942); Lumsden v. Lumsden\nBros. & Taylor Inc., 242 App. Div. 852, 257 N. Y. S. 221 (1934).\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Nor does a rule prohibiting waiver of representative\nstanding declare \u201cthat a contract is unenforceable just be-\ncause it requires bilateral arbitration.\u201d Epic Systems, 584\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). Indeed, if the term \u201cbilateral\narbitration\u201d is used to mean \u201carbitration in an individual\ncapacity between precisely two parties,\u201d a rule prohibiting\nrepresentative-capacity waivers cannot invalidate agree-\nments to arbitrate on a \u201cbilateral\u201d basis. An agreement that\nexplicitly provided for \u201carbitration on a strictly bilateral ba-\nsis\u201d would, under that definition of the term \u201cbilateral,\u201d cat-\negorically exclude representative-capacity claims from its\ncoverage. Such claims, after all, necessarily involve the rep-\nresentation of an absent principal, and thus cannot be arbi-\ntrated in a strictly bilateral proceeding. A rule prohibiting\nwaivers of representative standing would not invalidate\nany agreements that contracted for \u201cbilateral arbitration\u201d\nin Viking\u2019s sense\u2014it would simply require parties to choose\nwhether to litigate those claims or arbitrate them in a pro-\nceeding that is not bilateral in every conceivable sense. And\nwhile this consequence only follows because it is impossible\nto decide representative claims in an arbitration that is \u201cbi-\nlateral\u201d in every dimension, nothing in our precedent sug-\ngests that in enacting the FAA, Congress intended to re-\nquire States to reshape their agency law to ensure that\nparties will never have to arbitrate in a proceeding that de-\nviates from \u201cbilateral arbitration\u201d in the strictest sense. If\nthere is a conflict between California\u2019s prohibition on PAGA\nwaivers and the FAA, it must derive from a different source.\n                                III\n  We think that such a conflict between PAGA\u2019s procedural\nstructure and the FAA does exist, and that it derives from\nthe statute\u2019s built-in mechanism of claim joinder. As we\nnoted at the outset, that mechanism permits \u201caggrieved em-\nployees\u201d to use the Labor Code violations they personally\nsuffered as a basis to join to the action any claims that could\n\f18         VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v. MORIANA\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nhave been raised by the State in an enforcement proceed-\ning. Iskanian\u2019s secondary rule prohibits parties from con-\ntracting around this joinder device because it invalidates\nagreements to arbitrate only \u201cindividual PAGA claims for\nLabor Code violations that an employee suffered,\u201d 59 Cal.\n4th, at 383, 327 P. 3d, at 149.\n   This prohibition on contractual division of PAGA actions\ninto constituent claims unduly circumscribes the freedom of\nparties to determine \u201cthe issues subject to arbitration\u201d and\n\u201cthe rules by which they will arbitrate,\u201d Lamps Plus, 587\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7), and does so in a way that vio-\nlates the fundamental principle that \u201carbitration is a mat-\nter of consent,\u201d Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at 684. The most\nbasic corollary of the principle that arbitration is a matter\nof consent is that \u201ca party can be forced to arbitrate only\nthose issues it specifically has agreed to submit to arbitra-\ntion,\u201d First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S.\n938, 945 (1995). This means that parties cannot be coerced\ninto arbitrating a claim, issue, or dispute \u201cabsent an affirm-\native \u2018contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed\nto do so.\u2019 \u201d Lamps Plus, 587 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quot-\ning Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at 684); see also Concepcion,\n563 U. S., at 347\u2013348.\n   For that reason, state law cannot condition the enforcea-\nbility of an arbitration agreement on the availability of a\nprocedural mechanism that would permit a party to expand\nthe scope of the arbitration by introducing claims that the\nparties did not jointly agree to arbitrate. Rules of claim\njoinder can function in precisely that way. Modern civil pro-\ncedure dispenses with the formalities of the common-law\napproach to claim joinder in favor of almost-unqualified\njoinder. Wright & Miller \u00a71581. Federal Rule of Civil Pro-\ncedure 18(a), which permits a party to \u201cjoin, as independent\nor alternative claims, as many claims as it has against an\nopposing party,\u201d is typical of the modern approach. But the\nFAA licenses contracting parties to depart from standard\n\f                   Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             19\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nrules \u201cin favor of individualized arbitration procedures of\ntheir own design,\u201d so parties to an arbitration agreement\nare not required to follow the same approach. Epic Systems,\n584 U. S., at ____ (slip op., at 14). And that is true even if\nbifurcated proceedings are an inevitable result. See, e.g.,\nDean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 220\u2013221\n(1985); Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Con-\nstr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 103 (1983).\n   A state rule imposing an expansive rule of joinder in the\narbitral context would defeat the ability of parties to control\nwhich claims are subject to arbitration. Such a rule would\npermit parties to superadd new claims to the proceeding,\nregardless of whether the agreement between them com-\nmitted those claims to arbitration. Requiring arbitration\nprocedures to include a joinder rule of that kind compels\nparties to either go along with an arbitration in which the\nrange of issues under consideration is determined by coer-\ncion rather than consent, or else forgo arbitration alto-\ngether. Either way, the parties are coerced into giving up a\nright they enjoy under the FAA. See Lamps Plus, 587 U. S.,\nat ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 6\u20138); Epic Systems, 584 U. S., at ___\u2013\n___ (slip op., at 5\u20139); Concepcion, 563 U. S., at 347\u2013351;\nStolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at 684\u2013687.\n   When made compulsory by way of Iskanian, the joinder\nrule internal to PAGA functions in exactly this way. Under\nthat rule, parties cannot agree to restrict the scope of an\narbitration to disputes arising out of a particular \u201c \u2018 \u201ctrans-\naction\u201d \u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018common nucleus of facts.\u2019 \u201d Lucky Brand, 590\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). If the parties agree to arbitrate\n\u201cindividual\u201d PAGA claims based on personally sustained vi-\nolations, Iskanian allows the aggrieved employee to abro-\ngate that agreement after the fact and demand either judi-\ncial proceedings or an arbitral proceeding that exceeds the\nscope jointly intended by the parties. The only way for par-\nties to agree to arbitrate one of an employee\u2019s PAGA claims\nis to also \u201cagree\u201d to arbitrate all other PAGA claims in the\n\f20        VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v. MORIANA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsame arbitral proceeding.\n   The effect of Iskanian\u2019s rule mandating this mechanism\nis to coerce parties into withholding PAGA claims from ar-\nbitration. Liberal rules of claim joinder presuppose a back-\ndrop in which litigants assert their own claims and those of\na limited class of other parties who are usually connected\nwith the plaintiff by virtue of a distinctive legal relation-\nship\u2014such as that between shareholders and a corporation\nor between a parent and a minor child. PAGA departs from\nthat norm by granting the power to enforce a subset of Cal-\nifornia public law to every employee in the State. This com-\nbination of standing to act on behalf of a sovereign and man-\ndatory freeform joinder allows plaintiffs to unite a massive\nnumber of claims in a single-package suit. But as we have\nsaid, \u201c[a]rbitration is poorly suited to the higher stakes\u201d of\nmassive-scale disputes of this kind. Concepcion, 563 U. S.,\nat 350. The absence of \u201cmultilayered review\u201d in arbitral\nproceedings \u201cmakes it more likely that errors will go uncor-\nrected.\u201d Ibid. And suits featuring a vast number of claims\nentail the same \u201crisk of \u2018in terrorem\u2019 settlements that class\nactions entail.\u201d Ibid. As a result, Iskanian\u2019s indivisibility\nrule effectively coerces parties to opt for a judicial forum\nrather than \u201cforgo[ing] the procedural rigor and appellate\nreview of the courts in order to realize the benefits of pri-\nvate dispute resolution.\u201d Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at 685;\nsee also Concepcion, 563 U. S., at 350\u2013351. This result is\nincompatible with the FAA.\n                              IV\n  We hold that the FAA preempts the rule of Iskanian in-\nsofar as it precludes division of PAGA actions into individ-\nual and non-individual claims through an agreement to ar-\nbitrate. This holding compels reversal in this case. The\nagreement between Viking and Moriana purported to waive\n\u201crepresentative\u201d PAGA claims. Under Iskanian, this provi-\nsion was invalid if construed as a wholesale waiver of PAGA\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclaims. And under our holding, that aspect of Iskanian is\nnot preempted by the FAA, so the agreement remains inva-\nlid insofar as it is interpreted in that manner. But the sev-\nerability clause in the agreement provides that if the waiver\nprovision is invalid in some respect, any \u201cportion\u201d of the\nwaiver that remains valid must still be \u201cenforced in arbitra-\ntion.\u201d Based on this clause, Viking was entitled to enforce\nthe agreement insofar as it mandated arbitration of Mori-\nana\u2019s individual PAGA claim. The lower courts refused to\ndo so based on the rule that PAGA actions cannot be divided\ninto individual and non-individual claims. Under our hold-\ning, that rule is preempted, so Viking is entitled to compel\narbitration of Moriana\u2019s individual claim.\n   The remaining question is what the lower courts should\nhave done with Moriana\u2019s non-individual claims. Under\nour holding in this case, those claims may not be dismissed\nsimply because they are \u201crepresentative.\u201d Iskanian\u2019s rule\nremains valid to that extent. But as we see it, PAGA pro-\nvides no mechanism to enable a court to adjudicate non-\nindividual PAGA claims once an individual claim has been\ncommitted to a separate proceeding. Under PAGA\u2019s stand-\ning requirement, a plaintiff can maintain non-individual\nPAGA claims in an action only by virtue of also maintaining\nan individual claim in that action. See Cal. Lab. Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a72699(a), (c). When an employee\u2019s own dispute is pared\naway from a PAGA action, the employee is no different from\na member of the general public, and PAGA does not allow\nsuch persons to maintain suit. See Kim, 9 Cal. 5th, at 90,\n459 P. 3d, at 1133 (\u201cPAGA\u2019s standing requirement was\nmeant to be a departure from the \u2018general public\u2019 . . . stand-\ning originally allowed\u201d under other California statutes). As\na result, Moriana lacks statutory standing to continue to\nmaintain her non-individual claims in court, and the correct\ncourse is to dismiss her remaining claims.\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the California Court\nof Appeal is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\n\f22        VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v.

The Court faithfully ap-\nplies precedent to hold that California\u2019s anti-waiver rule for\nclaims under the State\u2019s Labor Code Private Attorneys Gen-\neral Act of 2004 (PAGA) is pre-empted only \u201cinsofar as it\nprecludes division of PAGA actions into individual and non-\nindividual claims through an agreement to arbitrate.\u201d\nAnte, at 20. In its analysis of the parties\u2019 contentions, the\nCourt also details several important limitations on the pre-\nemptive effect of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). See\nante, at 11\u201317. As a whole, the Court\u2019s opinion makes clear\nthat California is not powerless to address its sovereign con-\ncern that it cannot adequately enforce its Labor Code with-\nout assistance from private attorneys general.\n  The Court concludes that the FAA poses no bar to the ad-\njudication of respondent Angie Moriana\u2019s \u201cnon-individual\u201d\nPAGA claims, but that PAGA itself \u201cprovides no mechanism\nto enable a court to adjudicate non-individual PAGA claims\nonce an individual claim has been committed to a separate\nproceeding.\u201d Ante, at 21. Thus, the Court reasons, based\non available guidance from California courts, that Moriana\nlacks \u201cstatutory standing\u201d under PAGA to litigate her \u201cnon-\nindividual\u201d claims separately in state court.

If this is\n correct, Iskanian\u2019s prohibition on PAGA waivers presents parties with\n an impermissible choice: Either arbitrate disputes using a form of class\n procedures, or do not arbitrate at all. Moriana maintains that any\n conflict between Iskanian and the FAA is illusory because PAGA cre-\n ates nothing more than a substantive cause of action.\n    This Court disagrees with both characterizations of the statute. Mo-\n riana\u2019s premise that PAGA creates a unitary private cause of action is\n irreconcilable with the structure of the statute and the ordinary legal\n meaning of the word \u201cclaim.\u201d A PAGA action asserting multiple viola-\n tions under California\u2019s Labor Code affecting a range of different em-\n ployees does not constitute \u201ca single claim\u201d in even the broadest possi-\n ble sense. Viking\u2019s position, on the other hand, elides important\n structural differences between PAGA actions and class actions. A\n class-action plaintiff can raise a multitude of claims because he or she\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U.

As a result, PAGA suits exhibit virtually none of the proce-\ndural characteristics of class actions.\n   This Court\u2019s FAA precedents treat bilateral arbitration as the pro-\ntotype of the individualized and informal form of arbitration protected\nfrom undue state interference by the FAA. See, e.g., Epic Systems\nCorp. v. Lewis, 584 U. S. ___, ___. Viking posits that a proceeding is\n\u201cbilateral\u201d only if it involves two and only two parties and \u201cis conducted\nby and on behalf of the individual named parties only.\u201d Wal-Mart\nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219618\"><a href=\"/opinion/219618/wal-mart-stores-inc-v-dukes/\">564 U. S. 338</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 348. Thus, Iskanian\u2019s prohibition\non PAGA waivers is inconsistent with the FAA because PAGA creates\nan intrinsically representational form of action and Iskanian requires\nparties either to arbitrate in that format or forgo arbitration alto-\ngether.\n   This Court disagrees. Nothing in the FAA establishes a categorical\nrule mandating enforcement of waivers of standing to assert claims on\nbehalf of absent principals. Non-class representative actions in which\na single agent litigates on behalf of a single principal necessarily devi-\nate from the strict ideal of bilateral dispute resolution posited by Vi-\nking, but this Court has never held that the FAA imposes a duty on\nStates to render all forms of representative standing waivable by con-\ntract or that such suits deviate from the norm of bilateral arbitration.\nUnlike procedures distinctive to multiparty litigation, single-principal,\nsingle-agent representative actions are \u201cbilateral\u201d in two registers:\nThey involve the rights of only the absent real party in interest and\nthe defendant, and litigation need only be conducted by the agent-\nplaintiff and the defendant. Nothing in this Court\u2019s precedent sug-\ngests that in enacting the FAA, Congress intended to require States to\nreshape their agency law governing who can assert claims on behalf of\nwhom to ensure that parties will never have to arbitrate disputes in a\nproceeding that deviates from bilateral arbitration in the strictest\nsense. Pp. 7\u201317.\n   (b) PAGA\u2019s built-in mechanism of claim joinder is in conflict with the\nFAA. Iskanian\u2019s prohibition on contractual division of PAGA actions\ninto constituent claims unduly circumscribes the freedom of parties to\ndetermine \u201cthe issues subject to arbitration\u201d and \u201cthe rules by which\nthey will arbitrate,\u201d Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, 587 U.

For\nthat reason, state law cannot condition the enforceability of an agree-\nment to arbitrate on the availability of a procedural mechanism that\nwould permit a party to expand the scope of the anticipated arbitration\nby introducing claims that the parties did not jointly agree to arbitrate.\n\f4              VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v. MORIANA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    A state rule imposing an expansive rule of joinder in the arbitral con-\n    text would defeat the ability of parties to control which claims are sub-\n    ject to arbitration by permitting parties to superadd new claims to the\n    proceeding, regardless of whether the agreement committed those\n    claims to arbitration. When made compulsory by way of Iskanian,\n    PAGA\u2019s joinder rule functions in exactly this way. The effect is to co-\n    erce parties into withholding PAGA claims from arbitration. Is-\n    kanian\u2019s indivisibility rule effectively coerces parties to opt for a judi-\n    cial forum rather than \u201cforgo[ing] the procedural rigor and appellate\n    review of the courts to realize the benefits of private dispute resolu-\n    tion.\u201d Stolt-Nielsen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78783\"><a href=\"/opinion/78783/stolt-nielsen-s-a-v-animalfeeds-intl-corp/\">559 U.

But Iskanian\u2019s\n    rule that PAGA actions cannot be divided into individual and non-in-\n    dividual claims is preempted, so Viking was entitled to compel arbi-\n    tration of Moriana\u2019s individual claim. PAGA provides no mechanism\n    to enable a court to adjudicate non-individual PAGA claims once an\n    individual claim has been committed to a separate proceeding. And\n    under PAGA\u2019s standing requirement, a plaintiff has standing to main-\n    tain non-individual PAGA claims in an action only by virtue of also\n    maintaining an individual claim in that action. As a result, Moriana\n    would lack statutory standing to maintain her non-individual claims\n    in court, and the correct course was to dismiss her remaining claims.\n    Pp. 20\u201321.\nReversed and remanded.\n\n   ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BREYER, SO-\nTOMAYOR,    KAGAN, and GORSUCH, JJ., joined, in which ROBERTS, C.

Cali-\nfornia\u2019s Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA)\nhad the authority to bring enforcement actions to impose\ncivil penalties on employers for violations of many of the\ncode\u2019s provisions. But the legislature believed the LWDA\ndid not have sufficient resources to reach the appropriate\nlevel of compliance, and budgetary constraints made it im-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n *THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins Parts I and III of this opinion.\n\f2            VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v.

The leg-\nislature thus decided to enlist employees as private attor-\nneys general to enforce California labor law, with the un-\nderstanding that labor-law enforcement agencies were to\nretain primacy over private enforcement efforts.\n   By its terms, PAGA authorizes any \u201caggrieved employee\u201d\nto initiate an action against a former employer \u201con behalf of\nhimself or herself and other current or former employees\u201d\nto obtain civil penalties that previously could have been re-\ncovered only by the State in an LWDA enforcement action.\nCal. Lab. Code Ann. \u00a72699(a). As the text of the statute\nindicates, PAGA limits statutory standing to \u201caggrieved\nemployees\u201d\u2014a term defined to include \u201cany person who was\nemployed by the alleged violator and against whom one or\nmore of the alleged violations was committed.\u201d \u00a72699(c). To\nbring suit, however, an employee must also exhaust admin-\nistrative remedies. That entails providing notice to the em-\nployer and the LWDA of the violations alleged and the sup-\nporting facts and theories. \u00a72699.3(a)(1)(A). If the LWDA\nfails to respond or initiate an investigation within a speci-\nfied timeframe, the employee may bring suit. \u00a72699.3(a)(2).\nIn any successful PAGA action, the LWDA is entitled to 75\npercent of the award. \u00a72699(i). The remaining 25 percent\nis distributed among the employees affected by the viola-\ntions at issue.

The trial court denied that motion, and\nthe California Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that cate-\ngorical waivers of PAGA standing are contrary to state pol-\nicy and that PAGA claims cannot be split into arbitrable\nindividual claims and nonarbitrable \u201crepresentative\u201d\nclaims.\n   This ruling was dictated by the California Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Iskanian. In that case, the court held\nthat pre-dispute agreements to waive the right to bring\n\u201crepresentative\u201d PAGA claims are invalid as a matter of\npublic policy. What, precisely, this holding means requires\nsome explanation. PAGA\u2019s unique features have prompted\nthe development of an entire vocabulary unique to the stat-\nute, but the details, it seems, are still being worked out. An\nunfortunate feature of this lexicon is that it tends to use the\nword \u201crepresentative\u201d in two distinct ways, and each of\nthose uses of the term \u201crepresentative\u201d is connected with\none of Iskanian\u2019s rules governing contractual waiver of\nPAGA claims.\n   In the first sense, PAGA actions are \u201crepresentative\u201d in\nthat they are brought by employees acting as representa-\ntives\u2014that is, as agents or proxies\u2014of the State. But\nPAGA claims are also called \u201crepresentative\u201d when they are\npredicated on code violations sustained by other employees.\nIn the first sense, \u201c \u2018every PAGA action is . . . representa-\ntive\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[t]here is no individual component to a PAGA\naction,\u201d Kim, 9 Cal. 5th, at 87, 459 P. 3d, at 1131 (quoting\nIskanian, 59 Cal. 4th, at 387, 327 P. 3d, at 151), because\nevery PAGA claim is asserted in a representative capacity.\nBut when the word \u201crepresentative\u201d is used in the second\nway, it makes sense to distinguish \u201cindividual\u201d PAGA\nclaims, which are premised on Labor Code violations actu-\nally sustained by the plaintiff, from \u201crepresentative\u201d (or\nperhaps quasi-representative) PAGA claims arising out of\nevents involving other employees.

That is, it pre-\nvents parties from waiving representative standing to bring\nPAGA claims in a judicial or arbitral forum. But Iskanian\nalso adopted a secondary rule that invalidates agreements\nto separately arbitrate or litigate \u201cindividual PAGA claims\nfor Labor Code violations that an employee suffered,\u201d on the\ntheory that resolving victim-specific claims in separate ar-\nbitrations does not serve the deterrent purpose of PAGA.\n59 Cal. 4th, at 383, 327 P. 3d, at 149; see also Kim, 9 Cal.\n5th, at 88, 459 P. 3d, at 1132 (noting that based on Is-\nkanian, California courts have uniformly \u201crejected efforts to\nsplit PAGA claims into individual and representative com-\nponents\u201d).\n   In this case, Iskanian\u2019s principal prohibition required the\nlower courts to treat the representative-action waiver in the\nagreement between Moriana and Viking as invalid insofar\nas it was construed as a wholesale waiver of PAGA stand-\ning. The agreement\u2019s severability clause, however, allowed\nenforcement of any \u201cportion\u201d of the waiver that remained\nvalid, so the agreement still would have permitted arbitra-\ntion of Moriana\u2019s individual PAGA claim even if wholesale\nenforcement was impossible.

If this is correct, Iskanian\u2019s prohibition on\nPAGA waivers presents parties with the same impermissi-\nble choice as the rules we have invalidated in our decisions\nconcerning class- and collective-action waivers: Either arbi-\ntrate disputes using a form of class procedure, or do not ar-\nbitrate at all.\n  Moriana offers a very different characterization of the\nstatute. As she sees it, any conflict between Iskanian and\nthe FAA is illusory because PAGA creates nothing more\nthan a substantive cause of action. The only thing that is\ndistinctive about PAGA, she supposes, is that it allows em-\nployee plaintiffs to increase the available penalties that\nmay be awarded in an action by proving additional predi-\ncate violations of the Labor Code. But that does not make\na PAGA action a class action, because those violations are\nnot distinct claims belonging to distinct individuals. In-\nstead, they are predicates for expanded liability under a\nsingle cause of action. In Moriana\u2019s view, that means Is-\nkanian invalidates waivers of substantive rights, and does\nnot purport to invalidate anything that can meaningfully\nbe described as an \u201carbitration agreement.\u201d4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Moriana declines to defend one of the Iskanian court\u2019s own bases for\n\nholding that the FAA does not mandate enforcement of PAGA waivers.\nThe Iskanian court reasoned that a PAGA action lies outside the FAA\u2019s\ncoverage entirely because \u00a72 is limited to controversies \u201carising out of \u201d\nthe contract between the parties, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">9 U.

Indeed, if the term \u201cbilateral\narbitration\u201d is used to mean \u201carbitration in an individual\ncapacity between precisely two parties,\u201d a rule prohibiting\nrepresentative-capacity waivers cannot invalidate agree-\nments to arbitrate on a \u201cbilateral\u201d basis. An agreement that\nexplicitly provided for \u201carbitration on a strictly bilateral ba-\nsis\u201d would, under that definition of the term \u201cbilateral,\u201d cat-\negorically exclude representative-capacity claims from its\ncoverage. Such claims, after all, necessarily involve the rep-\nresentation of an absent principal, and thus cannot be arbi-\ntrated in a strictly bilateral proceeding. A rule prohibiting\nwaivers of representative standing would not invalidate\nany agreements that contracted for \u201cbilateral arbitration\u201d\nin Viking\u2019s sense\u2014it would simply require parties to choose\nwhether to litigate those claims or arbitrate them in a pro-\nceeding that is not bilateral in every conceivable sense. And\nwhile this consequence only follows because it is impossible\nto decide representative claims in an arbitration that is \u201cbi-\nlateral\u201d in every dimension, nothing in our precedent sug-\ngests that in enacting the FAA, Congress intended to re-\nquire States to reshape their agency law to ensure that\nparties will never have to arbitrate in a proceeding that de-\nviates from \u201cbilateral arbitration\u201d in the strictest sense.

This holding compels reversal in this case. The\nagreement between Viking and Moriana purported to waive\n\u201crepresentative\u201d PAGA claims. Under Iskanian, this provi-\nsion was invalid if construed as a wholesale waiver of PAGA\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

And under our holding, that aspect of Iskanian is\nnot preempted by the FAA, so the agreement remains inva-\nlid insofar as it is interpreted in that manner. But the sev-\nerability clause in the agreement provides that if the waiver\nprovision is invalid in some respect, any \u201cportion\u201d of the\nwaiver that remains valid must still be \u201cenforced in arbitra-\ntion.\u201d Based on this clause, Viking was entitled to enforce\nthe agreement insofar as it mandated arbitration of Mori-\nana\u2019s individual PAGA claim. The lower courts refused to\ndo so based on the rule that PAGA actions cannot be divided\ninto individual and non-individual claims. Under our hold-\ning, that rule is preempted, so Viking is entitled to compel\narbitration of Moriana\u2019s individual claim.\n   The remaining question is what the lower courts should\nhave done with Moriana\u2019s non-individual claims. Under\nour holding in this case, those claims may not be dismissed\nsimply because they are \u201crepresentative.\u201d Iskanian\u2019s rule\nremains valid to that extent. But as we see it, PAGA pro-\nvides no mechanism to enable a court to adjudicate non-\nindividual PAGA claims once an individual claim has been\ncommitted to a separate proceeding. Under PAGA\u2019s stand-\ning requirement, a plaintiff can maintain non-individual\nPAGA claims in an action only by virtue of also maintaining\nan individual claim in that action. See Cal. Lab. Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a72699(a), (c). When an employee\u2019s own dispute is pared\naway from a PAGA action, the employee is no different from\na member of the general public, and PAGA does not allow\nsuch persons to maintain suit. See Kim, 9 Cal. 5th, at 90,\n459 P. 3d, at 1133 (\u201cPAGA\u2019s standing requirement was\nmeant to be a departure from the \u2018general public\u2019 . . . stand-\ning originally allowed\u201d under other California statutes).

The Court faithfully ap-\nplies precedent to hold that California\u2019s anti-waiver rule for\nclaims under the State\u2019s Labor Code Private Attorneys Gen-\neral Act of 2004 (PAGA) is pre-empted only \u201cinsofar as it\nprecludes division of PAGA actions into individual and non-\nindividual claims through an agreement to arbitrate.\u201d\nAnte, at 20. In its analysis of the parties\u2019 contentions, the\nCourt also details several important limitations on the pre-\nemptive effect of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). See\nante, at 11\u201317. As a whole, the Court\u2019s opinion makes clear\nthat California is not powerless to address its sovereign con-\ncern that it cannot adequately enforce its Labor Code with-\nout assistance from private attorneys general.\n  The Court concludes that the FAA poses no bar to the ad-\njudication of respondent Angie Moriana\u2019s \u201cnon-individual\u201d\nPAGA claims, but that PAGA itself \u201cprovides no mechanism\nto enable a court to adjudicate non-individual PAGA claims\nonce an individual claim has been committed to a separate\nproceeding.\u201d Ante, at 21. Thus, the Court reasons, based\non available guidance from California courts, that Moriana\nlacks \u201cstatutory standing\u201d under PAGA to litigate her \u201cnon-\nindividual\u201d claims separately in state court. Ibid. Of\ncourse, if this Court\u2019s understanding of state law is wrong,\nCalifornia courts, in an appropriate case, will have the last\n\f2          VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC. v.

Alternatively, if this Court\u2019s understanding is right,\nthe California Legislature is free to modify the scope of stat-\nutory standing under PAGA within state and federal con-\nstitutional limits. With this understanding, I join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion.\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U.

TEXAS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 20\u2013493.      Argued February 22, 2022\u2014Decided June 15, 2022\nThis case represents the latest conflict between Texas gaming officials\n  and the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo Indian Tribe. In 1968, Congress recog-\n  nized the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo as an Indian tribe and assigned its\n  trust responsibilities for the Tribe to Texas. 82 Stat. 93. In 1983,\n  Texas renounced its trust responsibilities as inconsistent with the\n  State\u2019s Constitution. The State also expressed opposition to any new\n  federal trust legislation that did not permit the State to apply its own\n  gaming laws on tribal lands. Congress restored the Tribe\u2019s federal\n  trust status in 1987 when it adopted the Ysleta del Sur and Alabama\n  and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act. 101 Stat. 666.\n  The Restoration Act also \u201cprohibited\u201d as a matter of federal law \u201c[a]ll\n  gaming activities which are prohibited by the laws of the State of\n  Texas.\u201d Id., at 668. Shortly thereafter, Congress adopted its own com-\n  prehensive Indian gaming legislation: the Indian Gaming Regulatory\n  Act (IGRA). IGRA established rules for separate classes of games. As\n  relevant here, IGRA permitted Tribes to offer so-called class II\n  games\u2014like bingo\u2014in States that \u201cpermi[t] such gaming for any pur-\n  pose by any person, organization or entity.\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a72710(b)(1)(A).\n  IGRA allowed Tribes to offer class III games\u2014like blackjack and bac-\n  carat\u2014but only pursuant to negotiated tribal/state compacts.\n  \u00a72703(8).\n    Pursuant to IGRA, the Tribe sought to negotiate a compact with\n  Texas to offer class III games. Texas refused, arguing that the Resto-\n  ration Act displaced IGRA and required the Tribe to follow all of the\n  State\u2019s gaming laws on tribal lands. In subsequent federal litigation,\n  the District Court held that Texas violated IGRA by failing to negoti-\n  ate in good faith. The Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the Resto-\n\f2                 YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ration Act\u2019s directions superseded IGRA\u2019s and guaranteed that the en-\n    tirety of \u201cTexas\u2019 gaming laws and regulations\u201d would \u201coperate as sur-\n    rogate federal law on the Tribe\u2019s reservation.\u201d 36 F. 3d 1325, 1326,\n    1334 (Ysleta I). In 2016, the Tribe began to offer bingo, including \u201celec-\n    tronic bingo\u201d machines, on the view that IGRA treats bingo as a class\n    II game for which no state permission is required so long as the State\n    permits the game to be played on some terms by some persons. The\n    State then sought to shut down all of the Tribe\u2019s bingo operations.\n    Bound by Ysleta I, the District Court sided with Texas and enjoined\n    the Tribe\u2019s bingo operations, but the court stayed the injunction pend-\n    ing appeal. The Fifth Circuit reaffirmed Ysleta I and held that the\n    Tribe\u2019s bingo operations were impermissible because they did not con-\n    form to Texas\u2019s bingo regulations.\nHeld: The Restoration Act bans as a matter of federal law on tribal lands\n only those gaming activities also banned in Texas. Pp. 8\u201320.\n    (a) Section 107 of the Restoration Act directly addresses gaming on\n the lands of the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo. It provides in subsection (a)\n that \u201cgaming activities which are prohibited by [Texas law] are hereby\n prohibited on the reservation and on lands of the tribe.\u201d Subsection\n (b) insists that the statute does not grant Texas \u201ccivil or criminal reg-\n ulatory jurisdiction\u201d with respect to matters covered by \u00a7107. The\n State reads the Act as effectively subjecting the Tribe to the entire\n body of Texas gaming laws and regulations. The Tribe, however, un-\n derstands the Act to bar it from offering only those gaming activities\n the State fully prohibits, and that if Texas merely regulates bingo, the\n Tribe may also offer that game subject only to federal-law, not state-\n law, limitations.\n    The language of \u00a7107\u2014particularly its dichotomy between prohibi-\n tion and regulation\u2014presents Texas with a problem. Texas concedes\n that its laws do not \u201cforbid,\u201d \u201cprevent,\u201d \u201ceffectively stop,\u201d or \u201cmake im-\n possible\u201d bingo operations in the State. Webster\u2019s Third International\n Dictionary 1813 (defining \u201cprohibit\u201d). Instead, the State admits that\n it allows the game \u201caccording to rule[s]\u201d that \u201cfix the time,\u201d place, and\n manner in which it may be conducted. Id., at 1913 (defining \u201cregu-\n late\u201d). From this alone, Texas\u2019s bingo laws appear to fall on the regu-\n latory rather than prohibitory side of the line. In response, Texas de-\n scribes its laws as \u201cprohibiting\u201d bingo unless the State\u2019s regulations\n are followed and insists that it is merely seeking to do what subsection\n (a) allows.\n    Texas\u2019s understanding of the word \u201cprohibit\u201d would risk turning the\n Restoration Act\u2019s terms into an indeterminate mess. In Texas\u2019s view,\n laws regulating gaming activities become laws prohibiting gaming ac-\n tivities\u2014an interpretation that violates the rule against \u201cascribing to\n one word a meaning so broad\u201d that it assumes the same meaning as\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nanother statutory term. Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575.\nIndeterminacy aside, the State\u2019s interpretation would leave subsection\n(b)\u2014denying the State regulatory jurisdiction\u2014with no work to per-\nform. As a result, Texas\u2019s interpretation also defies another canon of\nstatutory construction\u2014the rule that courts must normally seek to\nconstrue Congress\u2019s work \u201cso that effect is given to all provisions.\u201d Cor-\nley v. United States, 556 U. S. 303, 314 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Seeking to give subsection (b) real work to perform, Texas sub-\nmits that the provision serves to deny its state courts and gaming\ncommission \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to punish violations of subsection (a) by\nsending such disputes to federal court instead. But that interpretation\nonly serves to render subsection (c), which grants federal courts \u201cex-\nclusive\u201d jurisdiction over subsection (a) violations, a nullity. A full look\nat the statute\u2019s structure suggests a set of simple and coherent com-\nmands; Texas\u2019s competing interpretation renders individual statutory\nterms duplicative and leaves whole provisions without work to per-\nform. Pp. 8\u201312.\n   (b) Important contextual clues resolve any remaining questions.\nCongress passed the Restoration Act six months after this Court\nhanded down its decision in California v. Cabazon Band of Mission\nIndians, 480 U. S. 202. There, the Court interpreted Public Law 280\u2014\na statute Congress had adopted in 1953 to allow a handful of States to\nenforce some of their criminal laws on certain tribal lands\u2014to mean\nthat only \u201cprohibitory\u201d state gaming laws could be applied on the In-\ndian lands in question, not state \u201cregulatory\u201d gaming laws. The Cab-\nazon Court held that California\u2019s bingo laws\u2014materially identical to\nTexas\u2019s laws here\u2014fell on the regulatory side of the ledger. This Court\ngenerally assumes that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of\nthis Court\u2019s relevant precedents. Ryan v. Valencia Gonzales, 568 U. S.\n57, 66. At the time Congress adopted the Restoration Act, Cabazon\nwas not only a relevant precedent; it was the precedent. In Cabazon\u2019s\nimmediate aftermath, Congress also adopted other laws governing\ntribal gaming that appeared to reference and employ in different ways\nCabazon\u2019s distinction between prohibition and regulation. See, e.g.,\nWampanoag Tribal Council of Gay Head, Inc., Indian Claims Settle-\nment Act of 1987, \u00a79, 101 Stat. 709\u2013710.\n   None of this is to say that the Tribe may offer gaming on whatever\nterms it wishes. The Restoration Act provides that a gaming activity\nprohibited by Texas law is also prohibited on tribal land as a matter of\nfederal law. Other gaming activities are subject to tribal regulation\nand must conform to the terms and conditions set forth in federal law,\nincluding IGRA to the extent applicable. Pp. 12\u201315.\n   (c) The State\u2019s remaining arguments are unavailing. Pp. 15\u201319.\n\f4                 YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n         (1) Texas asks the Court to focus on subsection (a) of the Restora-\n    tion Act, which ends with the statement that \u201c[t]he provisions of this\n    subsection are enacted in accordance with the tribe\u2019s request in Tribal\n    Resolution No. T. C.\u201302\u201386.\u201d 101 Stat. 668\u2013669. In that referenced\n    resolution, the Tribe announced its opposition to Texas\u2019s legislative ef-\n    forts to have its gaming laws apply on tribal lands. At the same time,\n    the Tribe also announced its own intention to prohibit gaming on its\n    reservation and authorized the acceptance of federal legislation pro-\n    hibiting gaming on tribal lands. Texas claims that the reference to the\n    tribal resolution suggests the Restoration Act should be read \u201cbroadly\u201d\n    to allow Texas to apply its gaming regulations on tribal lands. As an\n    initial matter, subsection (a) does not purport to incorporate that res-\n    olution into federal law\u2014something Congress knows how to do when\n    it wishes, see e.g., 25 U. S. C. \u00a75396(b). In addition, Texas\u2019s \u201cbroad\u201d\n    reading suffers from the same interpretative challenges already men-\n    tioned and defies Congress\u2019s apparent adoption of Cabazon\u2019s prohibi-\n    tory/regulatory distinction. Finally, on this Court\u2019s interpretation of\n    the Restoration Act, Congress did legislate \u201cin accordance with\u201d the\n    Tribe\u2019s resolution by expressly granting the Tribe federal recognition\n    and choosing not to apply Texas gaming regulations as surrogate fed-\n    eral law on tribal land. Pp. 15\u201318.\n         (2) Texas appeals to public policy and argues that attempts to dis-\n    tinguish between prohibition and regulation are sure to prove \u201cun-\n    workable.\u201d It is not, however, this Court\u2019s place to question whether\n    Congress adopted the wisest or most workable policy. That the Resto-\n    ration Act\u2019s prohibitory/regulatory distinction can and will generate\n    borderline cases hardly makes it unique among federal statutes. And\n    courts have applied the same prohibitory/regulatory framework for\n    decades under Public Law 280. Moreover, Texas\u2019s alternative inter-\n    pretation poses its own \u201cworkability\u201d challenges, as federal courts\n    would be charged with enforcing the minutiae of state gaming regula-\n    tions governing the conduct of permissible games.

Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498\nU. S. 505, 509 (1991). Under our Constitution, treaties, and\nlaws, Congress too bears vital responsibilities in the field of\ntribal affairs. See, e.g., United States v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193,\n200 (2004). From time to time, Congress has exercised its\nauthority to allow state law to apply on tribal lands where\nit otherwise would not. See Santa Clara Pueblo v. Mar-\ntinez, 436 U. S. 49, 60 (1978); Bryan v. Itasca County, 426\nU. S. 373, 392 (1976); Rice v. Olson, 324 U. S. 786, 789\n(1945). In this case, Texas contends that Congress ex-\npressly ordained that all of its gaming laws should be\ntreated as surrogate federal law enforceable on the Ysleta\ndel Sur Pueblo Reservation. In the end, however, we find\nno evidence Congress endowed state law with anything like\nthe power Texas claims.\n\f2            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                                I\n                               A\n  The Ysleta del Sur Pueblo is one of three federally recog-\nnized Indian Tribes in Texas. Its reservation lies near El\nPaso, and the Tribe today includes over 4,000 enrolled\nmembers. See About Us, Ysleta del Sur Pueblo (June 2022),\nhttps://www.ysletadelsurpueblo.org/about-us. The Tribe\ntraces its roots back to the 1680 Pueblo Revolt against the\nSpanish in New Mexico. In the revolt\u2019s aftermath, the\nSpanish retreated from Santa Fe to El Paso, and a large\nnumber of Ysleta Pueblo Indians accompanied them.\nS. Rep. No. 100\u201390, p. 6 (1987) (Senate Report); W. Tim-\nmons, El Paso 18 (1990) (Timmons). Soon, tribal members\nbuilt the Ysleta Mission, the oldest church in Texas, and in\n1751 Spain granted 23,000 acres to the Tribe for its home-\nland. See Senate Report 6\u20137; Timmons 36.\n  Things changed for the Tribe after Texas gained state-\nhood in 1845. The State disregarded Spain\u2019s land grant and\nbegan incorporating a town on tribal lands and issuing land\npatents to non-Indians. Senate Report 6\u20137. Over the years\nthat followed, the Tribe repeatedly lost lands \u201cwithout rec-\nompense.\u201d Timmons 181. Yet some tribal members re-\nmained on parts of their homeland, \u201cdetermin[ed] to pre-\nserve [their] language, customs, and traditions.\u201d Ibid. In\nthe late 1890s, the Tribe adopted a constitution to ensure\n\u201cthe survival of [its] ancient tribal organization.\u201d Ibid. Af-\nter years of struggle, the Tribe also won formal recognition\nfrom Texas in 1967 and Congress the following year. Id., at\n260\u2013261. In its 1968 legislation, Congress assigned its\ntrust responsibilities for the Tribe to Texas. 82 Stat. 93.\nThat trust relationship was important, as it ensured the\nTribe would retain the remaining 100 acres of land it pos-\nsessed and gain access to certain tribal funding programs.\nSee Timmons 261; see also R. Chambers, Judicial Enforce-\nment of the Federal Trust Responsibility to Indians, 27\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nStan. L. Rev. 1213, 1233\u20131234 (1975) (discussing trust ob-\nligations).\n   This arrangement persisted until 1983. That year, Texas\nrenounced its trust responsibilities, asserting that they\nwere inconsistent with the State\u2019s Constitution. See 2019\nWL 639971, *1 (WD Tex., Feb. 14, 2019). The Tribe re-\nsponded to this development by seeking new congressional\nlegislation to reestablish its trust relationship with the fed-\neral government. But that effort quickly became bogged\ndown in a dispute. Of all things, it concerned bingo. Texas,\nit seems, worried that allowing tribal gaming would have a\ndetrimental effect on \u201cexisting charitable bingo operations\nin the State of Texas.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 121. And be-\ncause Texas judged that its laws would be inapplicable on\ntribal lands without federal approval, the State opposed\nany new federal trust legislation unless it included a special\nprovision permitting it to apply its own gaming laws on the\nTribe\u2019s lands. See ibid.\n                              B\n   Years of negotiations ensued. But one development dur-\ning this period turned out to have particular salience even\nthough it did not immediately concern either the Tribe or\nTexas. In February 1987, this Court issued California v.\nCabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202. In it, the\nCourt addressed Public Law 280, a statute Congress had\nadopted in 1953 to allow a handful of States to enforce some\nof their criminal\u2014but not certain of their civil\u2014laws on\nparticular tribal lands. See Bryan, 426 U. S., at 383\u2013385.\nSeeking to apply that statutory direction in the context of\nIndian gaming, the Court held that, if a state law prohibits\na particular game, it falls within Public Law 280\u2019s grant of\ncriminal jurisdiction and a State may enforce its ban on\ntribal lands. Cabazon, 480 U. S., at 209\u2013210. But if state\nlaws merely regulate a game\u2019s availability, the Court ruled,\nPublic Law 280 does not permit a State to enforce its rules\n\f4            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\non tribal lands. See id., at 210\u2013211.\n  The Court then turned to apply this prohibitory/regula-\ntory distinction to California\u2019s bingo laws. Much like Texas\ntoday, California in 1987 permitted bingo in various cir-\ncumstances (including for charitable purposes), but treated\ndeviations from its rules as criminal violations. See id., at\n205, 208\u2013209. Because California allowed some bingo to be\nplayed, the Court reasoned, the State \u201cregulate[d] rather\nthan prohibit[ed]\u201d the game. Id., at 211. From this, it fol-\nlowed that Public Law 280 did not authorize the State to\napply its own bingo laws on tribal lands. Id., at 210\u2013211.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court rejected California\u2019s\nsuggestion that its laws were prohibitory rather than regu-\nlatory because they were enforceable by criminal sanctions,\nexplaining that \u201can otherwise regulatory law\u201d is not en-\nforceable under Public Law 280 merely because a State la-\nbels it \u201ccriminal.\u201d Id., at 211. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d the Court ex-\nplained, Public Law 280\u2019s \u201cdistinction\u201d between criminal\nand civil laws \u201ccould easily be avoided.\u201d Ibid.\n  It appears the Court\u2019s decision helped catalyze new legis-\nlation. After Cabazon, \u201ccongressional efforts to pass [In-\ndian gaming] legislation . . . that had been ongoing since\n1983 gained momentum, with Indian tribes\u2019 position\nstrengthened.\u201d W. Wood, The (Potential) Legal History of\nIndian Gaming, 63 Ariz. L. Rev. 969, 1027, and n. 353\n(2021) (Wood). In fact, just six months after the decision, in\nAugust 1987, Congress finally adopted the Ysleta del Sur\nand Alabama and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Resto-\nration Act, 101 Stat. 666 (Restoration Act). In that law,\nCongress restored the Tribe\u2019s federal trust status. And to\nresolve Texas\u2019s gaming objections, Congress seemingly\ndrew straight from Cabazon, employing its distinction be-\ntween prohibited and regulated gaming activity. The Res-\ntoration Act \u201cprohibited\u201d as a matter of federal law \u201c[a]ll\ngaming activities which are prohibited by the laws of the\nState of Texas.\u201d 101 Stat. 668. But the Act also provided\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat it should not be \u201cconstrued as a grant of civil or crimi-\nnal regulatory jurisdiction to the State of Texas.\u201d Id., at\n669.\n   That was not all Congress did. Because Cabazon left cer-\ntain States unable to apply their gaming regulations on In-\ndian reservations, some feared the Court\u2019s decision opened\nthe door to a significant amount of new and unregulated\ngaming on tribal lands. See R. Anderson, S. Krakoff, & B.\nBerger, American Indian Law: Cases and Commentary\n479\u2013480 (4th ed. 2020) (Anderson). In 1988, Congress\nsought to fill that perceived void by adopting its own com-\nprehensive national legislation: the Indian Gaming Regu-\nlatory Act (IGRA), 102 Stat. 2467, 25 U. S. C. \u00a7 2701 et seq.;\nAnderson 479\u2013482. IGRA established rules for three sepa-\nrate classes of games. Relevant here, the law permitted\nTribes to offer so-called class II games\u2014like bingo\u2014in\nStates that \u201cpermi[t] such gaming for any purpose by any\nperson, organization or entity.\u201d \u00a7 2710(b)(1)(A). Mean-\nwhile, the statute allowed Tribes to offer class III games\u2014\nlike blackjack and baccarat\u2014but only pursuant to\ntribal/state compacts. \u00a7 2703(8); Anderson 480. To ensure\ncompliance with the statute\u2019s terms, IGRA created the Na-\ntional Indian Gaming Commission. \u00a7 2704(a).\n                              C\n   In the 1990s, the Tribe sought to negotiate a compact\nwith Texas to offer class III games pursuant to IGRA. But\nTexas refused to come to the table. It argued that the Res-\ntoration Act displaced IGRA and required the Tribe to fol-\nlow all of the State\u2019s gaming laws on tribal lands.\n   That dispute quickly found its way to court. Initially, a\nfederal district court granted summary judgment for the\nTribe, holding that Texas violated IGRA by failing to nego-\ntiate in good faith. On appeal, however, the Fifth Circuit\nreversed. That court held that the Restoration Act\u2019s direc-\ntions superseded IGRA\u2019s and guaranteed that all of \u201cTexas\u2019\n\f6            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngaming laws and regulations\u201d would \u201coperate as surrogate\nfederal law on the Tribe\u2019s reservation.\u201d Ysleta del Sur\nPueblo v. Texas, 36 F. 3d 1325, 1326, 1334 (1994) (Ysleta I).\n   A quarter century of confusion and litigation followed.\nRepeatedly, the Tribe sought to conduct gaming operations\nwithin the confines of Ysleta I at its Speaking Rock Enter-\ntainment Center, which houses restaurants, bars, and con-\ncert venues. Repeatedly, Texas argued that the Tribe\u2019s ac-\ntivities exceeded the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate. Faced with\nthese disputes, lower courts experimented with a variety of\napproaches: enjoining all on-reservation gaming, instruct-\ning the Tribe to seek licenses from Texas regulators, and\neven requiring the Tribe to obtain preapproval from a fed-\neral court before offering any new gaming operations. One\ncourt described this process as having \u201ctransformed [it] into\na quasi-regulatory body overseeing and monitoring the mi-\nnutiae of the [Tribe\u2019s] gaming-related conduct.\u201d Texas v.\nYsleta del Sur Pueblo, 2016 WL 3039991, *19 (WD Tex.,\nMay 27, 2016).\n                               D\n   The current case represents just the latest in this long\nline. In 2016, the Tribe began offering bingo. On its view,\nit was free to offer at least this game because IGRA treats\nbingo as a class II game for which no state permission is\nrequired so long as the State permits the game to be played\non some terms by some persons.              See 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7 2710(b)(1)(A). Citing IGRA, the Tribe did not just offer\nthe sort of bingo played in church halls across the country.\nIt also offered \u201celectronic bingo,\u201d a game in which patrons\nsit at \u201cmachines [that] look similar to a traditional slot ma-\nchine.\u201d 2019 WL 639971, *5 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Unlike typical slot machines, however, \u201cthe un-\nderlying game is run using historical bingo draws.\u201d Ibid.\n   The State responded by seeking to shut down all of the\nTribe\u2019s bingo operations. Whatever IGRA may allow, Texas\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nargued, the Fifth Circuit was clear in Ysleta I that the Res-\ntoration Act forbids the Tribe from defying any of the\nState\u2019s gaming regulations. And, Texas stressed, under its\nlaws bingo remains permissible today only for charitable\npurposes and only subject to a broad array of regulations.\n  Finding itself bound by Ysleta I, the District Court sided\nwith Texas and enjoined the Tribe\u2019s bingo operations. But\nthe court also chose to stay its injunction pending appeal.\nThe court did so because it thought that either the Fifth\nCircuit or this Court might wish to reconsider Ysleta I. See\n2019 WL 5589051, *1 (WD Tex., Mar. 28, 2019). After all,\nthe Restoration Act effectively federalizes only those state\nlaws that prohibit gaming activities. The statute expressly\nstates that nothing in it may be read as authorizing Texas\nto enforce criminal or civil regulations on tribal lands. And\nwhen it comes to bingo, the State permits at least some\nforms of the game subject to regulation. In the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment, \u201cthe Tribe [had] a sufficient likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits\u201d under the terms of the Restoration\nAct \u201cto support a stay.\u201d Ibid. The District Court further\nfound that, without a stay, the injury to the Tribe would be\n\u201ctruly irreparable.\u201d Id., at *2. Speaking Rock\u2019s revenues\naccount for 60 percent of the Tribe\u2019s operating budget,\nwhich supports \u201csignificant educational, governmental, and\ncharitable initiatives.\u201d Ibid; Brief for Petitioners 17. And\nwhen Speaking Rock closed due to one of the many previous\ndisputes, tribal unemployment rose from 3 to 28 percent.\nSee id., at 18.\n   On appeal, the Fifth Circuit \u201cre-reaffirm[ed]\u201d Ysleta I and\nheld that the decision \u201cresolve[d] this dispute.\u201d 955 F. 3d\n408, 414, 417 (2020). Ysleta I expressly held that all of\n\u201cTexas\u2019 gaming laws and regulations . . . operate as surro-\ngate federal law on the Tribe\u2019s reservation.\u201d 955 F. 3d, at\n414 (emphasis deleted). And because the Tribe\u2019s bingo op-\nerations did not conform to the State\u2019s bingo regulations,\nthe court held, they were impermissible. Ibid.\n\f8            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  After the Tribe filed a petition for certiorari, this Court\ncalled for the views of the Solicitor General. The United\nStates argued that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s understanding of the\nRestoration Act took a wrong turn in Ysleta I and urged us\nto correct the error. See Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae on Pet. for Cert. 1. Ultimately, we agreed to take up\nthis case to consider that question. 595 U. S. ___ (2021).\n                               II\n                               A\n   Before us, the parties offer two very different accounts of\nthe Restoration Act. The State, in its only argument in sup-\nport of regulatory jurisdiction over the Tribe\u2019s gaming ac-\ntivities, reads the Act as effectively subjecting the Tribe to\nthe entire body of Texas gaming laws and regulations, just\nas the Fifth Circuit held in Ysleta I. The Tribe understands\nthe Act to bar it from offering only those gaming activities\nthe State fully prohibits. Consistent with Cabazon, the\nTribe submits, if Texas merely regulates a game like bingo,\nit may offer that game\u2014and it may do so subject only to the\nlimits found in federal law and its own law, not state law.\n   To resolve the parties\u2019 disagreement, we turn to \u00a7 107 of\nthe Restoration Act, where Congress directly addressed\ngaming on the Tribe\u2019s lands and said this:\n           \u201cSEC. 107. GAMING ACTIVITIES.\n(a) IN GENERAL.\u2014All gaming activities which are prohib-\nited by the laws of the State of Texas are hereby prohibited\non the reservation and on lands of the tribe. Any violation\nof the prohibition provided in this subsection shall be sub-\nject to the same civil and criminal penalties that are pro-\nvided by the laws of the State of Texas. The provisions of\nthis subsection are enacted in accordance with the tribe\u2019s\nrequest in Tribal Resolution No. T.C.\u201302\u201386 which was ap-\nproved and certified on March 12, 1986.\n(b) NO STATE REGULATORY JURISDICTION.\u2014Nothing in this\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsection shall be construed as a grant of civil or criminal reg-\nulatory jurisdiction to the State of Texas.\n(c)   JURISDICTION      OVER    ENFORCEMENT         AGAINST\nMEMBERS.\u2014 [T]he courts of the United States shall have\nexclusive jurisdiction over any offense in violation of sub-\nsection (a) that is committed by the tribe . . . .\u201d 101 Stat.\n668\u2013669.\n   Perhaps the most striking feature about this language is\nits dichotomy between prohibition and regulation. On the\none hand, subsection (a) says that gaming activities prohib-\nited by state law are also prohibited as a matter of federal\nlaw (using some variation of the word \u201cprohibited\u201d no fewer\nthan three times). On the other hand, subsection (b) insists\nthat the statute does not grant Texas civil or criminal reg-\nulatory jurisdiction with respect to matters covered by this\n\u201csection,\u201d a section concerned exclusively with gaming. The\nimplication that Congress drew from Cabazon and meant\nfor us to apply its same prohibitory/regulatory framework\nhere seems almost impossible to ignore. See Part II\u2013B, in-\nfra.\n   But before getting to that, we start with a careful look at\nthe statute\u2019s terms standing on their own. Often enough in\nordinary speech, to prohibit something means to \u201cforbid,\u201d\n\u201cprevent,\u201d or \u201ceffectively stop\u201d it, or \u201cmake [it] impossible.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third International Dictionary 1813 (1986)\n(Webster\u2019s Third); see 7 Oxford English Dictionary 596 (2d\ned. 1989) (OED); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1212 (6th ed. 1990)\n(Black\u2019s). Meanwhile, to regulate something is usually un-\nderstood to mean to \u201cfix the time, amount, degree, or rate\u201d\nof an activity \u201caccording to rule[s].\u201d Webster\u2019s Third 1913;\nsee 8 OED 524; Black\u2019s 1286. Frequently, then, the two\nwords are \u201cnot synonymous.\u201d Id., at 1212.\n   That fact presents Texas with a problem. The State con-\ncedes that its laws do not forbid, prevent, effectively stop,\nor make bingo impossible. Instead, the State admits that it\n\f10            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nallows the game subject to fixed rules about the time, place,\nand manner in which it may be conducted. See Brief for\nRespondent 5. From this alone, it would seem to follow that\nTexas\u2019s laws fall on the regulatory rather than prohibitory\nside of the line\u2014and thus may not be applied on tribal lands\nunder the terms of subsection (b).\n   To be sure, Texas is not without a reply. It observes that\nin everyday speech someone could describe its laws as \u201cpro-\nhibiting\u201d bingo unless the State\u2019s time, place, and manner\nregulations are followed. After all, conducting bingo or any\nother game in defiance of state regulations can lead not just\nto a civil citation, but to a criminal prosecution too. See Tex.\nOcc. Code Ann. \u00a7 2001.551(c) (West 2019). In this sense,\nthe State submits, it seeks to do exactly what subsection (a)\nallows\u2014\u201cprohibit\u201d bingo that is not conducted for charitable\npurposes and compliant with all its state gaming regula-\ntions.\n   That much we find hard to see. Maybe in isolation or in\nanother context, Texas\u2019s understanding of the word \u201cpro-\nhibit\u201d would make sense. But here it risks rendering the\nRestoration Act a jumble. No one questions that Texas\n\u201cregulates\u201d bingo by fixing the time, place, and manner in\nwhich the game may be conducted. The State submits only\nthat, in some sense, its laws also \u201cprohibit\u201d bingo\u2014when\nthe game fails to comply with the State\u2019s time, place, and\nmanner regulations. But on that reading, the law\u2019s dichot-\nomy between prohibition and regulation collapses. Laws\nregulating gaming activities become laws prohibiting gam-\ning activities. It\u2019s an interpretation that violates our usual\nrule against \u201cascribing to one word a meaning so broad\u201d\nthat it assumes the same meaning as another statutory\nterm. Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575 (1995).\nIt\u2019s a view that defies our usual presumption that \u201cdiffer-\nences in language like this convey differences in meaning.\u201d\nHenson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U. S. ___, ___\n(2017) (slip op., at 6). And perhaps most tellingly, it is a\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconstruction that renders state gaming regulations simul-\ntaneously both (permissible) prohibitions and (impermissi-\nble) regulations. Rather than supply coherent guidance,\nTexas\u2019s reading of the law renders it an indeterminate\nmess.\n   The State\u2019s interpretation of subsection (a) presents an-\nother related problem. Suppose we could somehow overlook\nthe indeterminacy its interpretation yields and adopt the\nState\u2019s view that it may \u201cprohibit\u201d bingo under subsec-\ntion (a) not merely by outlawing bingo altogether but also\nby dictating the time, place, and manner in which it is\nplayed. On that account, subsection (b) would be left with\nno work to perform, its terms dead letters all. Yes, subsec-\ntion (b) says that it does not federalize Texas\u2019s civil and\ncriminal gaming regulations on tribal land. But, the State\neffectively suggests, we should turn a blind eye to all that.\nIt\u2019s a result that defies yet another of our longstanding can-\nons of statutory construction\u2014this one, the rule that we\nmust normally seek to construe Congress\u2019s work \u201cso that\neffect is given to all provisions, so that no part will be inop-\nerative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\u201d Corley v.\nUnited States, 556 U. S. 303, 314 (2009) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Seeking a way around these problems, Texas only stum-\nbles on another. The State submits that subsection (b) per-\nforms real work even on its reading by denying its courts\nand gaming commission \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to punish violations\nof subsection (a) and sending disputes over \u201cregulatory\u201d vi-\nolations to federal court instead. The dissent also embraces\nthis approach. See post, at 14\u201315. But this understanding\nof subsection (b) only serves to render still another portion\nof the statute\u2014subsection (c)\u2014a nullity. Titled \u201cJurisdic-\ntion Over Enforcement Against Members,\u201d subsection (c)\ngrants the federal courts \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction over viola-\ntions of subsection (a), and it also permits Texas to \u201cbrin[g]\n\f12              YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v.

Put differently, subsection (c) al-\nready precludes state courts and state agencies from exer-\ncising jurisdiction over violations of subsection (a). To make\nany sense of the statute, subsection (b) must do something\nbesides repeat that work.\n   Stepping back, a full look at the statute\u2019s structure sug-\ngests a set of simple and coherent commands. In subsec-\ntion (a), Congress effectively federalized and applied to\ntribal lands those state laws that prohibit or absolutely ban\na particular gaming activity. In subsection (b), Congress\nexplained that it was not authorizing the application of\nTexas\u2019s gaming regulations on tribal lands. In subsec-\ntion (c), Congress granted federal courts jurisdiction to en-\ntertain claims by Texas that the Tribe has violated subsec-\ntion (a). Texas\u2019s competing interpretation of the law\nrenders individual statutory terms duplicative and whole\nprovisions without work to perform.1\n                               B\n     Even if fair questions remain after a look at the ordinary\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The dissent offers a surplusage argument of its own, arguing that the\n\nCourt\u2019s reading of \u00a7 107 duplicates the work done by \u00a7 105(f ). See post,\nat 12. That is mistaken. Section 105(f ) does not specifically address\ntribal gaming, but instead broadly extends Public Law 280 and its asso-\nciated jurisdictional rules to the Tribe\u2019s reservation. By contrast, \u00a7 107\nspeaks only and specifically to gaming. And while it does extend much\nof the Public Law 280 regime to tribal gaming, it also departs from that\nframework in at least two significant ways. First, \u00a7 107 incorporates\nTexas\u2019s criminal gaming prohibitions as surrogate federal law, while\nPublic Law 280 allows particular States to apply their own laws directly\nto tribal lands. Second, it establishes unique jurisdictional rules for ju-\ndicial review of alleged violations of Texas\u2019s gaming prohibitions. See\npost, at 13. Where Public Law 280 grants state courts jurisdiction over\nviolations of state criminal prohibitory laws, subsection (c) grants federal\ncourts exclusive jurisdiction over alleged violations of \u00a7 107, \u201c[n]otwith-\nstanding section 105(f ).\u201d There is no superfluity here.\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmeaning of the statutory terms before us, important con-\ntextual clues resolve them. Recall that Congress passed the\nAct just six months after this Court handed down Cabazon.\nSee Part I\u2013B, supra. In that decision, the Court interpreted\nPublic Law 280 to mean that only \u201cprohibitory\u201d state gam-\ning laws could be applied on the Indian lands in question,\nnot state \u201cregulatory\u201d gaming laws. The Court then pro-\nceeded to hold that California bingo laws\u2014laws materially\nidentical to the Texas bingo laws before us today\u2014fell on\nthe regulatory side of the ledger. Just like Texas today,\nCalifornia heavily regulated bingo, allowing it only in cer-\ntain circumstances (usually for charity). Just like Texas,\nCalifornia criminalized violations of its rules. Compare\nCabazon, 480 U. S., at 205, with Tex. Occ. Code Ann.\n\u00a7 2001.551. Still, because California permitted some forms\nof bingo, the Court concluded that meant California did not\nprohibit, but only regulated, the game. Cabazon, 480 U. S.,\nat 211.\n   For us, that clinches the case. This Court generally as-\nsumes that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of\nthis Court\u2019s relevant precedents. See Ryan v. Valencia Gon-\nzales, 568 U. S. 57, 66 (2013). And at the time Congress\nadopted the Restoration Act, Cabazon was not only a rele-\nvant precedent concerning Indian gaming; it was the prece-\ndent. See Part I\u2013B, supra. In Cabazon, the Court drew a\nsharp line between the terms prohibitory and regulatory\nand held that state bingo laws very much like the ones now\nbefore us qualified as regulatory rather than prohibitory in\nnature. We do not see how we might fairly read the terms\nof the Restoration Act except in the same light. After all,\n\u201c[w]hen the words of the Court are used in a later statute\ngoverning the same subject matter, it is respectful of Con-\ngress and of the Court\u2019s own processes to give the words the\nsame meaning in the absence of specific direction to the con-\ntrary.\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 434 (2000).\n   Even beyond that vital contextual clue lie others. In the\n\f14           YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimmediate aftermath of Cabazon, Congress adopted not\njust the Restoration Act; it also adopted other laws govern-\ning tribal gaming activities. In these laws, Congress again\nappeared to reference and employ Cabazon\u2019s distinction be-\ntween prohibition and regulation\u2014and Congress did so in\nways demonstrating that it clearly understood how to grant\na State regulatory jurisdiction over a Tribe\u2019s gaming activ-\nities when it wished to do so. Cf. Lagos v. United States,\n584 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at 6\u20137).\n   Consider two examples. On the same day it passed the\nRestoration Act, Congress adopted a statute involving the\nWampanoag Tribe. But, contrary to its approach in the\nRestoration Act, Congress subjected that Tribe\u2019s lands to\n\u201cthose laws and regulations which prohibit or regulate the\nconduct of bingo or any other game of chance.\u201d Wampanoag\nTribal Council of Gay Head, Inc., Indian Claims Settlement\nAct of 1987, \u00a7 9, 101 Stat. 709\u2013710 (emphasis added).\nShortly after the Restoration Act, Congress adopted an-\nother statute, this one governing the Catawba Tribe\u2019s gam-\ning activities. In it, Congress provided that \u201call laws, ordi-\nnances, and regulations of the State, and its political\nsubdivisions, shall govern the regulation of . . . gambling or\nwagering by the Tribe on and off the Reservation.\u201d Ca-\ntawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina Land Claims Settle-\nment Act of 1993, \u00a7 14(b), 107 Stat. 1136 (emphasis added).\n   That Congress chose to use the language of Cabazon in\ndifferent ways in three statutes closely related in time and\nsubject matter seems to us too much to ignore. See State\nFarm Fire & Casualty Co. v. United States ex rel. Rigsby,\n580 U. S. 26, 34 (2016) (explaining that when Congress\n\u201cuse[s] . . . explicit language in one provision,\u201d that \u201ccau-\ntions against inferring the same limitation in another pro-\nvision\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). For two\nTribes, Congress did more than just prohibit on tribal lands\nthose gaming activities prohibited by state law. It said\nstate regulations should apply as a matter of federal law\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntoo. Yet for this Tribe Congress did something different. It\ndid not subject the Tribe to all Texas laws that \u201cprohibit or\nregulate\u201d gaming. It did not subject the Tribe to all laws\nthat \u201cgovern the regulation of gambling.\u201d Instead, Con-\ngress banned on tribal lands only those gaming activities\n\u201cprohibited\u201d by Texas, and it did not provide for state \u201creg-\nulatory jurisdiction\u201d over tribal gaming.2\n   None of this is to say that the Tribe may offer any gaming\nactivity on whatever terms it wishes. It is only to say that\nthe Fifth Circuit and Texas have erred in their understand-\ning of the Restoration Act. Under that law\u2019s terms, if a gam-\ning activity is prohibited by Texas law it is also prohibited\non tribal land as a matter of federal law. Other gaming ac-\ntivities are subject to tribal regulation and must conform\nwith the terms and conditions set forth in federal law, in-\ncluding IGRA to the extent it is applicable. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 31\u201333.3\n                             III\n                              A\n  By this point, only two arguments remain for us to con-\nsider. In the first, Texas and the dissent focus heavily on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The dissent speculates about ways Congress could have even more\n\nclearly communicated its intention to ban only those games prohibited\nby Texas. See post, at 8\u20139. But rather than compare the Restoration Act\nto hypothetical language Congress could have used, it seems more appro-\npriate to compare the Act\u2019s terms to language Congress did use in closely\nrelated statutes addressing precisely the same subject, including in one\npassed the very same day as this Act. The dissent cannot and does not\ndeny that Congress could have employed the language it used in the\nWampanoag and Catawba statutes. That Congress took a different ap-\nproach strongly suggests it had in mind a different set of rules for this\nTribe.\n   3 In reaching this conclusion, we need not rely on the rule\u2014long estab-\n\nlished by our precedents\u2014that \u201cstatutes are to be construed liberally in\nfavor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their ben-\nefit.\u201d Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U. S. 759, 766 (1985). On our view,\nTexas\u2019s interpretation fails even without recourse to that rule.\n\f16            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe final sentence in subsection (a). See post, at 9\u201310, 13.\nThat sentence states that \u201c[t]he provisions of this subsec-\ntion are enacted in accordance with the tribe\u2019s request in\nTribal Resolution No. T.C.\u201302\u201386.\u201d 101 Stat. 668\u2013669. In\nthe referenced 1986 resolution, the Tribe announced its op-\nposition to Texas\u2019s legislative efforts to have all its gaming\nlaws apply on tribal lands. Such a result, the resolution\nsaid, would represent \u201ca substantial infringement upon the\nTribe[\u2019s] power of self-government . . . [ i]nconsistent with\nthe central purposes of restoration of the federal trust rela-\ntionship.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 122. At the same time, to\nprevent extension of Texas law to its reservation and to\navoid \u201cjeopardiz[ing]\u201d its request for renewed federal trust\nstatus, the Tribe (1) announced its own intention to prohibit\ngaming or bingo on its reservation, and (2) authorized its\nnegotiators in Washington to accept federal legislation pro-\nhibiting gaming on tribal lands as an alternative to state\nregulation. Id., at 123. Before us, Texas does not question\nthat the Tribe was (and remains) free to change its own\nlaws after adopting that resolution. But, the State says, the\nfact that Congress referenced the tribal resolution in sub-\nsection (a) suggests that the Restoration Act should be read\n\u201cbroadly\u201d to allow Texas to apply its gaming regulations on\ntribal lands. Brief for Respondent 22.\n   It\u2019s an unsatisfying suggestion for at least a few reasons.\nIn the first place, while subsection (a) explains that the Res-\ntoration Act was \u201cenacted in accordance with\u201d the Tribe\u2019s\nresolution, it does not purport to incorporate that resolution\ninto federal law. Congress knows exactly how to adopt into\nfederal law the terms of another writing or resolution when\nit wishes. It can and has said, for example, that a tribal law\nor resolution \u201cshall have the same force and effect as if it\nwere set out in full in this subchapter.\u201d 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7 5396(b). But even Texas does not suggest that Congress\nwent that far in the Restoration Act.\n   With that possibility shelved, it is hard to see what\u2019s left.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nTexas suggests that Congress\u2019s reference to the tribal reso-\nlution at least augurs in favor of a \u201cbroa[d]\u201d reading of sub-\nsection (a). Brief for Respondent 22; see also post, at 9\u201310.\nBut saying that tells us nothing about how much broader\nthe law should be read. And, as we have seen, the only\n\u201cbroader\u201d reading of subsection (a) Texas offers faces its\nchallenges\u2014 it requires us to believe that subsection (a)\nswallows subsection (b) whole, makes a nullity of subsection\n(c), and defies Congress\u2019s apparent adoption of Cabazon\u2019s\nprohibitory/regulatory distinction.\n   There is still another and maybe more fundamental prob-\nlem here. On our interpretation of the Restoration Act,\nCongress did legislate \u201cin accordance with\u201d the Tribe\u2019s res-\nolution: It expressly granted the Tribe federal recognition\nand chose not to apply Texas gaming regulations as surro-\ngate federal law on tribal land. Of course, Congress also\nsought to act in accordance with at least some of Texas\u2019s\nconcerns by banning those games fully barred by Texas law.\nIn the end, it seems each got half a loaf.\n   By contrast, adopting Texas\u2019s alternative interpretation\nof the Restoration Act would make a mockery of Congress\u2019s\nstatement that it sought to act \u201cin accordance with\u201d the\nTribe\u2019s resolution. On the State\u2019s view, all of its gaming\nregulations serve as surrogate federal law applicable on\ntribal lands. That\u2019s a result few would dare to describe as\n\u201caccord[ing] with\u201d the tribal resolution. In fact, it\u2019s an out-\ncome more nearly the opposite of what the Tribe sought and\ncloser to what it described as a \u201cwholly unsatisfactory . . .\ninfringement upon the Tribe[\u2019s] power of self government\u201d\nand \u201c[i]nconsistent with the central purposes of restoration\nof the federal trust relationship.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 122.\n   To be sure and as Texas and the dissent both highlight,\nthe statutory terms Congress finally settled on were in\nsome respects more generous to the Tribe than those its res-\nolution authorized tribal negotiators in Washington to ac-\ncept. Rather than ban all gaming on tribal lands, Congress\n\f18               YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nbanned only those games forbidden in Texas. But this de-\nvelopment is hardly surprising either. The Tribe adopted\nits resolution in 1986 in connection with negotiations over\na bill that eventually died in the Senate. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 3\u20134, 30. As talks continued\nthe following year, this Court issued Cabazon. And after\nthat, as we have seen, Tribes across the country saw their\nnegotiating \u201cposition strengthened.\u201d Wood 1027, and n.\n353; see also Part I\u2013B, supra. The dissent omits these es-\nsential details from its account of how the Restoration Act\nbecame law. See post, at 3. That omission leads the dissent\nto overlook one plausible explanation for why the Tribe got\nthe deal it did. It may be that, thanks to Cabazon, the\nTribe\u2019s representatives were able to persuade Congress to\nimpose a less draconian ban\u2014one that paralleled the terms\nthis Court in Cabazon found applicable to many other\nTribes under Public Law 280. Surely, too, as we have seen,\nif Congress had intended a more complete federal ban, it\ncould have easily said so. Not by obliquely referencing a\ntribal resolution, but by saying so clearly, just as it did for\nboth the Wampanoag and Catawba Tribes. See Part II\u2013B,\nsupra.4\n                             B\n  In the end, Texas retreats to the usual redoubt of failing\nstatutory interpretation arguments: an unadorned appeal\nto public policy. Echoing arguments voiced by the Cabazon\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The dissent tries to reshape the tribal resolution to its liking by dis-\n\ntilling it down to a \u201csingle \u2018request[ ]\u2019 \u201d to \u201cban on the reservation all gam-\ning as defined by Texas.\u201d Post, at 3, 9. And it chides the Court for con-\nsulting \u201cexcerpts from the Resolution\u2019s preamble\u201d that complicate the\ndissent\u2019s narrative. Post, at 10. But the entire document is an expression\nof the Tribe\u2019s views. If we are to rely on the resolution as a snapshot of\nthe Tribe\u2019s position, it makes little sense to ignore much of it. In any\nevent, courts regularly consult preambles and recitals even in statutes\nand contracts. See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 217\u2013220 (2012).\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndissent, the State argues that attempts to distinguish be-\ntween prohibition and regulation are sure to prove \u201cun-\nworkable.\u201d Brief for Respondent 29 (citing 480 U. S., at 224\n(opinion of Stevens, J.)). Indeed, the State suggests that\nproblems are likely to arise in this very case. Under our\nreading, Texas highlights, courts on remand might be called\non to decide whether \u201celectronic bingo\u201d qualifies as \u201cbingo\u201d\nand thus a gaming activity merely regulated by Texas, or\nwhether it constitutes an entirely different sort of gaming\nactivity absolutely banned by Texas and thus forbidden as\na matter of federal law. And, the State worries, any at-\ntempt to answer that question may require evidence, expert\ntestimony, and further litigation.\n   We appreciate these concerns, but they do not persuade\nus. Most fundamentally, they are irrelevant. It is not our\nplace to question whether Congress adopted the wisest or\nmost workable policy, only to discern and apply the policy\nit did adopt. If Texas thinks good governance requires a\ndifferent set of rules, its appeals are better directed to those\nwho make the laws than those charged with following them.\n   Even on its own terms, we are not sure what to make of\nTexas\u2019s policy argument. We do not doubt that the Resto-\nration Act\u2019s prohibitory/regulatory distinction can and will\ngenerate borderline cases. See F. Cohen, Handbook of Fed-\neral Indian Law 541\u2013544 (N. Newton ed. 2012). It may even\nbe that electronic bingo will prove such a case. But if ap-\nplying the Act\u2019s terms poses challenges, that hardly makes\nit unique among federal statutes. Nor is the line the Resto-\nration Act asks us to enforce quite as unusual as Texas sug-\ngests. Courts have applied the same prohibitory/regulatory\nframework elsewhere in this country under Public Law 280\nfor decades. See id., at 541\u2013547. IGRA, too, draws a similar\nline to assess the propriety of class II gaming on Indian res-\nervations nationwide. See 25 U. S. C. \u00a7 2710(b)(1)(A); see\nalso K. Washburn, Federal Law, State Policy, and Indian\nGaming, 4 Nev. L. J. 285, 289\u2013290 (2004). In fact, Texas\n\f20           YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconcedes that another Tribe within its borders\u2014the Kicka-\npoo Traditional Tribe of Texas\u2014is already subject to IGRA\nand offers class II games. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 91; see also\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32. Why some-\nthing like the Cabazon test can work for one Tribe in Texas\nbut not another is not exactly obvious.\n   For that matter, Texas\u2019s alternative interpretation poses\nits own \u201cworkability\u201d challenges. Under the State\u2019s read-\ning, subsection (c) does not just charge federal courts with\nenforcing on tribal lands a federal law banning gaming ac-\ntivities also banned by state law. It also charges federal\ncourts with enforcing the minutiae of state gaming regula-\ntions governing the conduct of permissible games\u2014a role\nusually played by state gaming commissions or the Na-\ntional Indian Gaming Commission. It\u2019s a highly unusual\nrole for federal courts to assume. But on Texas\u2019s view, it\u2019s\na role federal courts must assume, as indeed they have\nsought to do since Ysleta I. And far from yielding an easily\nadministrable regime, by almost anyone\u2019s account that pro-\nject has engendered a quarter century of confusion and dis-\npute. See Part I\u2013C, supra.\n                               *\n  Texas contends that Congress in the Restoration Act has\nallowed all of its state gaming laws to act as surrogate fed-\neral law on tribal lands. The Fifth Circuit took the same\nview in Ysleta I and in the proceedings below. That under-\nstanding of the law is mistaken. The Restoration Act bans\nas a matter of federal law on tribal lands only those gaming\nactivities also banned in Texas. To allow the Fifth Circuit\nto revise its precedent and reconsider this case in the cor-\nrect light, its judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                 So ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Congress passed a bill codifying this\narrangement. The key statutory provision states, \u201c[a]ll\ngaming activities which are prohibited by the laws of the\nState of Texas are hereby prohibited on the reservation and\non lands of the tribe.\u201d Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama\nand Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act,\n\u00a7107(a), 101 Stat. 668 (Restoration Act). The Tribe now\nwishes to engage in various high-stakes gaming activities\nthat would clearly violate Texas law\u2014if Texas law applies.\nThe question presented in this case is whether all of Texas\u2019s\ngaming laws apply on tribal land, or only those laws that\ncategorically ban a particular game.\n   The Court today concludes that the latter reading of the\nstatute is the better one. I disagree. A straightforward\nreading of the statute\u2019s text makes clear that all gaming\nactivities prohibited in Texas are also barred on the Tribe\u2019s\nland. The Court\u2019s contrary interpretation is at odds with\nthe statute\u2019s plain meaning, conflicts with an unambiguous\ntribal resolution that the Act was \u201cenacted in accordance\nwith,\u201d id., at 668\u2013669, and makes a hash of the statute\u2019s\nstructure.

The Tribe first received federal\nrecognition in 1968. At that time, Congress simultaneously\ntransferred the United States\u2019 trust responsibilities to the\nState of Texas. See Tiwa Indians Act of 1968, Pub. L. 90\u2013\n287, 82 Stat. 93. Texas thereafter held the Tribe\u2019s land in\ntrust, and Texas law applied in full on the reservation.\n  The situation became tenuous, however, in 1983. That\nyear Texas\u2019s Attorney General issued an opinion concluding\nthat the State\u2019s trust relationship with a similarly situated\nTribe violated the Texas Constitution. This led to a great\ndeal of uncertainty about the Pueblo\u2019s future. Efforts began\nto establish, for the first time, a direct trust relationship\nbetween the Tribe and the Federal Government. But a key\nsticking point soon emerged: the status of gaming on the\nreservation.\n  Texas has long maintained strict controls on gambling.\nIndeed, since 1876 the Texas Constitution has required the\nState\u2019s legislature to \u201cpass laws prohibiting\u201d such activities.\nArt. III, \u00a747; see also Fort Worth v. Rylie, 602 S. W. 3d 459,\n460 (Tex. 2020). While the Texas Constitution now con-\ntains limited exceptions for charitable bingo and raffles, as\nwell as the State\u2019s official lottery, its ban on casino-style\ngaming remains absolute. With the Pueblo seeking federal\ntrust status, Texas officials worried that if the State\u2019s gam-\ning laws no longer applied on tribal lands, the Tribe\u2019s small\nreservation might soon become a large hub for high-stakes\ngaming.\n  In 1985, Congress considered a bill that would have\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             3\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ngranted the Pueblo federal trust status. The bill also would\nhave authorized gaming on the Tribe\u2019s land, so long as it\noccurred \u201cpursuant to a tribal ordinance or law\u201d that had\nbeen \u201capproved by the Secretary of the Interior.\u201d H. R.\n1344, \u00a7107, 99th Cong., 1st Sess., 15. The bill passed the\nHouse of Representatives but stalled in the Senate due to\nopposition from Texas state officials and members of the\nTexas congressional delegation. They were concerned that\nthe bill \u201cdid not provide adequate protection against high\nstakes gaming operations on the Tribe\u2019s reservation.\u201d\nTexas v. Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, 220 F. Supp. 2d 668, 677\n(WD Tex. 2001).\n   In response, the Tribe adopted a resolution, which is of\ncentral importance to this case. See Tribal Resolution No.\nTC\u201302\u201386 (Mar. 12, 1986), App. to Pet. for Cert. 121\u2013124.\nThe resolution\u2019s preamble contains a series of prefatory\nclauses. One states that the Tribe has \u201c[n]o interest in con-\nducting high stakes bingo or other gambling operations on\nits reservation.\u201d Id., at 121. Another says the Tribe re-\nmains \u201cfirm in its commitment to prohibit outright any\ngambling or bingo in any form on its reservation.\u201d Id., at\n123 (emphasis added). At the same time, other clauses as-\nsert the Tribe\u2019s view that proposals \u201cto make state gaming\nlaw applicable on the reservation [are] wholly unsatisfac-\ntory\u201d and represent a \u201csubstantial infringement upon\n[tribal] self government.\u201d Id., at 122. Still, the Tribe con-\ncluded, \u201cthe controversy over gaming must not be permitted\nto jeopardize\u201d legislation granting it federal trust status.\nId., at 123. So the Tribal Council made a single \u201crequest[]\u201d:\nthat its congressional representatives amend the pending\nlegislation to \u201cprovide that all gaming, gambling, lottery, or\nbingo, as defined by the laws and administrative regula-\ntions of the State of Texas, shall be prohibited on the Tribe\u2019s\nreservation or on tribal land.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   The Tribe\u2019s request ultimately led to enactment of the\nRestoration Act, which is the statute at issue in this case.\n\f4             YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nSee 101 Stat. 666; see also Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, 220\nF. Supp. 2d, at 677\u2013679. The Act contains various provi-\nsions setting forth the relationship between the Tribe, the\nState of Texas, and the United States. Two statutory pro-\nvisions are particularly pertinent. The first addresses gen-\neral application of Texas law on the reservation, and the\nsecond addresses the more specific application of Texas\u2019s\ngaming laws.\n   First, in \u00a7105(f ) of the Act, Congress made the Public\nLaw 280 framework applicable to the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo.\n101 Stat. 668. The Tribe, Texas, and the United States all\nembrace this interpretation of the Act. See Brief for Peti-\ntioners 25; Brief for Respondent 18; Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 12. Public Law 280 allows certain States\nto apply in full their criminal laws, and some of their civil\nlaws, on tribal lands. See Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U. S.\n373 (1976); see also ante, at 3\u20134. The law was designed to\naddress \u201cthe problem of lawlessness on certain Indian res-\nervations.\u201d Bryan, 426 U. S., at 379. In California v. Cab-\nazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202 (1987), the\nCourt interpreted Public Law 280 to mean that state laws\nthat are \u201c \u2018criminal/prohibitory\u2019 \u201d apply on designated reser-\nvations, whereas those laws that are merely \u201c \u2018civil/regula-\ntory\u2019 \u201d do not, id., at 209. Put differently, we said, \u201cif the\nintent of a state law is generally to prohibit certain conduct,\nit falls within Pub. L. 280\u2019s grant of criminal jurisdiction [to\nthe State], but if the state law generally permits the con-\nduct at issue, subject to regulation, it must be classified as\ncivil/regulatory and Pub. L. 280 does not authorize its en-\nforcement on an Indian reservation.\u201d Ibid. Because \u00a7105(f )\ngrants Texas Public Law 280 authority on Pueblo lands, the\nState may directly enforce all of its laws that generally pro-\nhibit conduct.\n   Second, Congress adopted a more specific rule to govern\ngaming on the reservation, which is set forth at \u00a7107 of the\nRestoration Act. The provision has three parts. Section\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             5\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n107(a) begins with the primary rule. It states unequivocally\nthat \u201c[a]ll gaming activities which are prohibited by the\nlaws of the State of Texas are hereby prohibited on the res-\nervation and on lands of the tribe.\u201d 101 Stat. 668. It con-\ntinues by noting that this rule was \u201cenacted in accordance\nwith the tribe\u2019s request in Tribal Resolution No. T.C.\u201302\u2013\n86.\u201d Id., at 669.\n  The next part, \u00a7107(b), says that the section\u2019s prohibition\non gaming on the reservation should not be construed as a\n\u201cgrant of civil or criminal regulatory jurisdiction to the\nState of Texas.\u201d Ibid.\n  Finally, \u00a7107(c) clarifies how the gaming provision is to\nbe enforced: \u201cNotwithstanding section 105(f ), the courts of\nthe United States\u201d\u2014rather than Texas courts\u2014\u201cshall have\nexclusive jurisdiction over any offense in violation of\n[\u00a7107(a)].\u201d Ibid. \u201cHowever,\u201d \u00a7107(c) continues, \u201cnothing in\nthis section shall be construed as precluding the State of\nTexas from bringing an action in the courts of the United\nStates to enjoin violations of the provisions of this section.\u201d\nIbid. This means that\u2014unlike most state laws that apply\non tribal land, which Texas can directly enforce given its\nauthority under \u00a7105(f )\u2014Texas cannot directly enforce its\ngaming laws in state court. Instead, if Texas determines\nthe Tribe is conducting prohibited gaming activities, it\nmust seek relief by way of a federal-court injunction.\n                              B\n  It was not long before things wound up in federal court.\nThe Pueblo sued first. Although the Tribe had previously\nexpressed its \u201cfirm\u201d \u201ccommitment to prohibit outright any\ngambling or bingo in any form on its reservation,\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 123, it now wished to host a bonanza of high-\nstakes, casino-style games, including baccarat, blackjack,\ncraps, roulette, and more, Ysleta del Sur Pueblo Tribe v.\nTexas, 36 F. 3d 1325, 1331, n. 12 (CA5 1994). The dispute\nmade its way to the Fifth Circuit, which ruled against the\n\f6            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nTribe. The court held that through the Restoration Act,\n\u201cCongress\u2014and the Tribe\u2014intended for Texas\u2019 gaming\nlaws and regulations to operate as surrogate federal law on\nthe Tribe\u2019s reservation in Texas.\u201d Id., at 1334. The Tribe\nwas thus required to follow all of Texas\u2019s gaming rules un-\nless it could persuade Congress to repeal the Restoration\nAct. We denied certiorari. 514 U. S. 1016 (1995).\n    For more than 25 years, this straightforward interpreta-\ntion of the Restoration Act held. Yet the Tribe continually\npushed the Act\u2019s limits, resulting in numerous successful\nrequests for injunctive relief from Texas to enforce its gam-\ning laws. See, e.g., 955 F. 3d 408, 412 (CA5 2020). In sev-\neral instances, federal courts had to hold tribal officials in\ncontempt for disregarding injunctions. Ibid.\n    The present litigation traces back to 2016. After a Dis-\ntrict Court enjoined illegal \u201c \u2018sweepstakes\u2019 \u201d games being\nconducted by the Pueblo, the Tribe announced it would be\n\u201c \u2018transitioning to bingo.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. As noted, Texas outlaws\nalmost all gambling, though it does permit charitable bingo\nactivities in certain limited situations.\n    In 2017, Texas inspected the Pueblo\u2019s Speaking Rock En-\ntertainment Center to determine whether it was complying\nwith state law. The answer appeared to be \u201cno.\u201d Slot ma-\nchines are outlawed in Texas, as are \u201cgambling device ver-\nsions of bingo.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a747.01(4)(A) (West\n2011); see also \u00a747.02(a)(3) (West Supp. 2021). Yet inside\nthe Tribe\u2019s casino, officials found more than 2,000 machines\nthat looked exactly like \u201c \u2018Las-Vegas-style slot machines.\u2019 \u201d\n955 F. 3d, at 412. Players press a button, graphics spin,\nnoise plays, and eventually players learn whether they\nhave won or lost. The machines are accessible 24 hours a\nday and, for added effect, are emblazoned with names like\n\u201cBig Texas Payday,\u201d \u201cWelcome to Fabulous Las Vegas,\u201d and\n\u201cLucky Duck.\u201d 2019 WL 639971, *5 (WD Tex., Feb. 14,\n2019). Although the machines resemble slot machines in\nevery relevant respect, the Tribe insisted they were a form\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

But the\nconditions under which these actual bingo games were con-\nducted violated Texas law in many ways. See Tex. Occ.\nCode Ann. \u00a72001.419 (West Supp. 2021) (setting forth cer-\ntain bingo restrictions).\n   Texas filed suit in federal court seeking injunctive relief\nagainst the Tribe and tribal officials. The District Court\ngranted an injunction, holding that \u201cthe Tribe\u2019s bingo oper-\nations fail to comply with Texas law.\u201d 2019 WL 639971,\n*11. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, concluding that in ex-\nchange for federal trust status, \u201cthe Pueblo agreed that its\ngaming activities would comply with Texas law,\u201d including\nall of the State\u2019s gaming regulations. 955 F. 3d, at 410. We\ngranted certiorari. 595 U. S. ___ (2021).\n                               II\n   At this point in the litigation, the Tribe does not argue\nthat all of its gaming activities are consistent with Texas\nlaw. Rather, it insists that Texas\u2019s gaming laws simply do\nnot apply to it, unless Texas categorically bans the playing\nof a particular type of game altogether. The Tribe does not\nmake this argument based primarily on the text or struc-\nture of the statute. It instead relies on Cabazon Band of\nMission Indians, 480 U. S. 202, which interpreted Public\nLaw 280. The Tribe asks us to treat \u00a7107 of the Restoration\nAct as implicitly adopting Cabazon Band\u2019s framework,\nwhich distinguishes between laws that are \u201c \u2018criminal/pro-\nhibitory\u2019 \u201d and laws that are \u201c \u2018civil/regulatory.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 209.\nUnder this framework, state laws that totally prohibit a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 A photograph from the record of this version of \u201cbingo\u201d is appended to\n\nthis opinion. It confirms that the electronic bingo played at the Speaking\nRock Entertainment Center is about as close to real bingo as Bingo the\nfamous dog.\n\f8            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntype of activity apply on tribal land, while state laws that\nsimply regulate the activity do not. And as the Tribe sees\nit, Texas does not ban the playing of bingo under all circum-\nstances, so none of the State\u2019s restrictions on the game ap-\nply.\n   The Court today accepts the Tribe\u2019s position, but I am not\npersuaded.\n                             A\n                             1\n  I begin with the statute\u2019s plain text. Section 107(a) pro-\nvides:\n      \u201cAll gaming activities which are prohibited by the\n    laws of the State of Texas are hereby prohibited on the\n    reservation and on lands of the tribe. Any violation of\n    the prohibition provided in this subsection shall be sub-\n    ject to the same civil and criminal penalties that are\n    provided by the laws of the State of Texas. The provi-\n    sions of this subsection are enacted in accordance with\n    the tribe\u2019s request in Tribal Resolution No. T.C.\u201302\u201386\n    which was approved and certified on March 12, 1986.\u201d\n    101 Stat. 668\u2013669.\nThe best reading of this statute is that all of Texas\u2019s gam-\nbling rules apply in full on the Tribe\u2019s land. \u201cAll\u201d gaming\nactivities prohibited by Texas are prohibited on the reser-\nvation. \u201cAny\u201d violation is subject to the same penalties that\nTexas would ordinarily impose.\n  The Tribe posits that this plain text may be read to refer\nonly to the banning of entire games\u2014such as poker, bacca-\nrat, or roulette. See Brief for Petitioners 27\u201328. But had\nCongress wished to adopt this narrower definition of \u201cgam-\ning activities,\u201d it easily could have done so. For example, it\ncould have referred to \u201ctypes of gambling,\u201d or mentioned\nthat the prohibition would apply only if Texas \u201cflatly,\u201d \u201ccat-\negorically,\u201d or \u201ccompletely\u201d banned a particular type of\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

Congress did not do so.\n                               2\n   Further textual evidence points decisively in the same di-\nrection. Section 107(a) says that it was \u201cenacted in accord-\nance with the tribe\u2019s request in Tribal Resolution No. T.C.\u2013\n02\u201386.\u201d 101 Stat. 668\u2013669 (emphasis added). As noted\nabove, the Tribal Resolution contains just a single \u201cre-\nquest[ ]\u201d: that Congress enact \u201clanguage which would pro-\nvide that all gaming, gambling, lottery, or bingo, as defined\nby the laws and administrative regulations of the State of\nTexas, shall be prohibited on the Tribe\u2019s reservation or on\ntribal land.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 123. This language is\ncategorical. So the breadth of the Tribe\u2019s request, and Con-\ngress\u2019s clear statement that it enacted \u00a7107(a) in accord-\nance with that request, strongly indicate that Congress in-\ntended to ban \u201call\u201d gaming activities\u2014\u201cas defined by\u201d\nTexas\u2014that are inconsistent with Texas law.2\n   The Court does not view the Tribal Resolution as signifi-\ncant because Congress did not \u201cpurport to incorporate [it]\ninto federal law.\u201d Ante, at 16. But this is not mere legisla-\ntive history; it is statutory text. Congress told us exactly\nwhy it did what it did: It was acting in accord with the\nTribe\u2019s request that it ban on the reservation all gaming as\ndefined by Texas.\n   The Court says that \u201cCongress did legislate \u2018in accord-\nance with\u2019 the Tribe\u2019s resolution\u201d because it \u201cexpressly\ngranted the Tribe federal recognition and chose not to apply\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Court argues that we omit \u201cessential details\u201d from our account of\n\nthe tribal resolution\u2014namely, the fact that California v. Cabazon Band\nof Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202 (1987), was decided after the resolu-\ntion\u2019s enactment but before passage of the Restoration Act. Ante, at 18.\nThe Court says it is \u201cplausible\u201d this led to a better deal for the Tribe.\nIbid. But \u00a7107(a) does not mention Cabazon Band. Instead, its express\nterms say the provision was \u201cenacted in accordance with the tribe\u2019s re-\nquest\u201d in the resolution. 101 Stat. 668\u2013669. The resolution is therefore\nthe essential reference point.\n\f10              YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nTexas gaming regulations as surrogate federal law on tribal\nland.\u201d Ante, at 17. Texas, the Court suggests, should be\nhappy to have gotten what had never been in question from\nthe beginning\u2014a ban on games fully barred by the State.\nThat was its \u201chalf a loaf.\u201d Ibid.\n  In making this claim, the Court relies on cherry-picked\nexcerpts from the resolution\u2019s preamble. But the text of\n\u00a7107(a) of the Restoration Act rules out the Court\u2019s analy-\nsis. Section 107(a) expressly states that the provision was\n\u201cenacted in accordance with the tribe\u2019s request in Tribal\nResolution No. T.C.\u201302\u201386.\u201d 101 Stat. 668\u2013669 (emphasis\nadded). As noted, the resolution contains only one single\n\u201crequest[ ]\u201d\u2014that Congress ban on tribal lands \u201call gaming,\ngambling, lottery, or bingo, as defined by the laws and ad-\nministrative regulations of the State of Texas.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 123 (emphasis added). The resolution\u2019s preamble\nmakes up no part of this \u201crequest,\u201d so the Court\u2019s reliance\non it is misplaced. \u201cOr to put the point differently, operative\nprovisions should be given effect as operative provisions,\nand prologues as prologues.\u201d District of Columbia v. Heller,\n554 U. S. 570, 578, n. 3 (2008).3\n  In sum, \u00a7107(a) of the Restoration Act is best read to\nmean that all of Texas\u2019s gaming laws apply on the Tribe\u2019s\nreservation.\n                               B\n     The Court rejects this straightforward interpretation of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The Court accuses the dissent of \u201creshap[ing] the tribal resolution to\n\nits liking\u201d by focusing on the Tribe\u2019s request in the resolution. Ante, at\n18, n. 4. The reason we focus on the \u201crequest\u201d in the tribal resolution is\nbecause that is precisely what Congress directed us to do. See 101 Stat.\n668\u2013669. Of course, as this opinion elsewhere makes clear, the resolu-\ntion\u2019s preamble is emphatic in expressing the Tribe\u2019s intent to prohibit\nall gaming activities and its willingness to compromise on the application\nof state gaming law in order to secure federal trust status. See supra, at\n3.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             11\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe statute for one main reason: It adopts the Tribe\u2019s argu-\nment that the use of the word \u201cprohibited\u201d in \u00a7107(a) im-\nplicitly incorporates the jurisdictional framework of Public\nLaw 280 and Cabazon Band.\n                                1\n    There are a number of reasons to be skeptical of this ap-\nproach. First, Congress knew how to incorporate the Public\nLaw 280 framework where it wished to do so. We know that\nbecause that is precisely what Congress did in \u00a7105(f ) of\nthe Restoration Act. There is little reason to think that\nCongress would have done so elsewhere in the very same\nAct with nothing more than a wink and a nudge.\n    Second, there is no evidence that Congress intended to\nuse the word \u201cprohibited\u201d in \u00a7107(a) as a term of art. The\nword \u201cprohibit\u201d appears thousands of times in the U. S.\nCode. See Brief for Respondent 24, n. 6. The fact that our\ndecision in Cabazon Band used this generic term to describe\nthe bounds of Public Law 280 is hardly enough to turn it\ninto a term of art with a more particularized meaning.\n    Third, the text of \u00a7107(a) of the Restoration Act bears lit-\ntle resemblance to the statutory language of Public Law\n280. Compare 18 U. S. C. \u00a71162 and 28 U. S. C. \u00a71360 (set-\nting forth provisions of Public Law 280) with \u00a7107 of the\nRestoration Act. Thus, this is not a situation where a more\nrecent enactment carries with it the \u201cold soil\u201d of a predeces-\nsor statute or rule. See F. Frankfurter, Some Reflections\non the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537\n(1947).\n    Finally, the language used in \u00a7107 does not signal an in-\ntent to adopt Cabazon Band\u2019s unique dichotomy between\nlaws that are \u201c \u2018criminal/prohibitory\u2019 \u201d and those that are\n\u201c \u2018civil/regulatory.\u2019 \u201d 480 U. S., at 209. The Tribe points to\n\u00a7107(a)\u2019s use of the word \u201cprohibited\u201d and \u00a7107(b)\u2019s refer-\nence to the State lacking \u201cregulatory jurisdiction\u201d on tribal\nlands to suggest that only Texas\u2019s gaming laws that are\n\f12           YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v.

But\n\u00a7107(a) also says that both Texas\u2019s \u201ccivil and criminal pen-\nalties\u201d apply when the Tribe engages in prohibited gaming\nactivities. Id., at 668 (emphasis added). And \u00a7107(a) was\nenacted \u201cin accordance with\u201d the Tribal Resolution, id., at\n668\u2013669, which specifies that the Restoration Act outlaws\n\u201call gaming, gambling, lottery, or bingo, as defined by the\nlaws and administrative regulations of the State of Texas,\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 123 (emphasis added). These express\nreferences to \u201ccivil\u201d penalties and \u201cadministrative regula-\ntions\u201d make it unlikely that Congress intended to implicitly\nincorporate only Texas\u2019s gaming laws that are criminal/pro-\nhibitory. To the extent Congress legislated with Cabazon\nBand\u2019s dichotomy in mind, the crosscutting language that\nCongress used suggests it intended to incorporate both\ntypes of laws.\n                               2\n   The foregoing is confirmed by the structure of the Resto-\nration Act and its statutory history. As noted above, \u00a7105(f )\nincorporates the Public Law 280 framework. The Tribe\ndoes not dispute this. See Brief for Petitioners 26\u201327. Sec-\ntion 107(a) then provides a more specific rule for gaming\nactivities. This is thus the common case where \u201c[a] specific\nprovision\u201d\u2014\u00a7107(a)\u2014\u201ccontrols [over] one of more general\napplication.\u201d Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395,\n407 (1991).\n   The Tribe disagrees. It argues that while \u00a7105(f ) of the\nRestoration Act incorporated Public Law 280\u2019s Cabazon\nBand framework, \u00a7107(a) did so as well. See Brief for Peti-\ntioners 26\u201328. But if \u00a7105(f )\u2014and its incorporation of Cab-\nazon Band\u2014already applied to gaming activities that were\ngenerally prohibited in Texas, there would have been no\nneed for Congress to enact the more specific rule of \u00a7107(a).\nThe Tribe\u2019s proffered reading of the statute thus runs head-\nlong into the canon against surplusage. See A. Scalia & B.\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                  13\n\n                       ROBERTS, C.

The key roadblock\nto the Tribe obtaining federal trust status was a concern\nthat it would permit gambling. The Tribe obtained federal\ntrust status only after striking a deal on this issue. See Ys-\nleta del Sur Pueblo, 220 F. Supp. 2d, at 677. It would make\nlittle sense for Congress to have enacted \u00a7107(a)\u2019s limita-\ntions on gaming merely to duplicate the rules already set\nforth in \u00a7105(f ). And it would make even less sense for Con-\ngress to have done so while simultaneously indicating that\nit was enacting the gaming prohibition \u201cin accordance with\nthe tribe\u2019s request,\u201d \u00a7107(a), 101 Stat. 668\u2013669, that it ban\non tribal lands \u201call gaming, gambling, lottery, or bingo, as\ndefined by the laws and administrative regulations of the\nState of Texas\u201d\u2014full stop, App. to Pet. for Cert. 123 (em-\nphasis added).\n   What\u2019s more, the Tribe\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7107\u2014em-\nbraced by the Court today\u2014leads to a bizarre result: Viola-\ntions of Texas\u2019s criminal gaming prohibitions receive more\nlenient treatment than all other violations of Texas\u2019s crim-\ninal laws. Under \u00a7105(f ), Texas may directly enforce in\nstate court all of its laws that are \u201ccriminal/prohibitory.\u201d\nBut under \u00a7107(c), Texas may enforce its gaming laws only\nthrough federal-court injunctions. This diminished enforce-\nment authority would make sense if the full breadth of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In response, the Court focuses on the different treatment of Texas\u2019s\n\ngaming laws under \u00a7\u00a7107(b) and (c). See ante, at 12, n. 1. But the Court\ndoes not dispute that under its reading of the Restoration Act, \u00a7107(a)\nreadopted the substantive Cabazon Band standard already required by\n\u00a7105(f ), even though \u00a7105(f ) comes just a few sentences earlier in the\nstatute and uses distinct language not present in \u00a7107(a) to expressly\nadopt the Public Law 280 framework.\n\f14            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nTexas\u2019s gaming prohibitions applied on tribal lands. But in\na universe where \u00a7107(a) bars no conduct beyond what\n\u00a7105(f ) already prohibits, it would make little sense for\nTexas to have less enforcement authority over gaming when\nthat was the only sticking point prior to passage of the Res-\ntoration Act. This is a sure-fire sign that something has\ngone badly awry in the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7107.\n   The Tribal Resolution confirms this point. The House of\nRepresentatives passed H. R. 1344 in December 1985. That\nversion of the bill already contained the pertinent language\napplying Public Law 280 to the Tribe. See H. R. 1344,\n\u00a7105(f ), 99th Cong., 1st Sess., 6. Under that regime, the\nTribe would have had the same authority that other tribes\nhad under Public Law 280 to offer games not altogether\nbanned by a State. But H. R. 1344 stalled in the Senate,\nand the Tribe adopted its resolution. The resolution made\nclear that the Tribe was offering a concession that would\nlimit its ability to offer gambling to a greater extent than\nunder H. R. 1344 and its existing incorporation of Public\nLaw 280. That is why the Tribe objected that it was being\nunfairly \u201csingl[ed] out . . . for treatment different than that\naccorded other Tribes in this country.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n123.\n   Still, the Tribe wanted\u2014and needed\u2014federal trust sta-\ntus, more than gambling. In fact, the Tribe asserted in the\npreamble to the resolution that it had \u201cno interest in con-\nducting high stakes bingo or other gambling operations\u201d\nand remained \u201cfirm in its commitment to prohibit outright\nany gambling or bingo in any form on its reservation.\u201d Id.,\nat 121, 123. Given its interest in federal trust status and\nits lack of interest in gaming, the Tribe requested that Con-\ngress \u201camend\u201d H. R. 1344 to add language banning \u201call\ngaming, gambling, lottery, or bingo\u201d on its reservation.\nIbid. Since the then-existing text of H. R. 1344 already\nmade Public Law 280 applicable to the Tribe, it is plain that\nthe proposed addition in \u00a7107 was designed to go further.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

J., dissenting\n\nThe Court\u2019s construction of \u00a7107\u2014as merely extending the\nPublic Law 280 framework to gaming on Pueblo lands, and\nthen watering down that framework through \u00a7107(c)\u2019s lim-\nitation on remedies\u2014is untenable.\n                               3\n   The Tribe insists that a contrary interpretation of \u00a7107(a)\nwould render \u00a7\u00a7107(b) and (c) meaningless, or would at\nleast result in undue tension between those provisions and\nsubsection (a). See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners 30\u201331. I dis-\nagree.\n   The Tribe focuses primarily on \u00a7107(b). That provision\nstates, \u201cNothing in this section shall be construed as a grant\nof civil or criminal regulatory jurisdiction to the State of\nTexas.\u201d 101 Stat. 669. The Tribe and Court contend that\nthis reservation of authority shows that Congress intended\nto adopt the Cabazon Band framework. Ante, at 9\u201310. But\nif \u00a7107(a) simply adopted Cabazon Band, why would there\nhave been any need to say so again in \u00a7107(b)? Section\n107(b) only makes sense if \u00a7107(a) raised questions about\nhow far Texas\u2019s authority reached beyond the limits of Cab-\nazon Band. Section 107(b) simply but importantly clarifies\nthat \u00a7107(a) adopts only Texas\u2019s substantive gaming laws\nand associated penalties. What \u00a7107(a) cannot be con-\nstrued to do\u2014according to \u00a7107(b)\u2014is to authorize Texas to\nexercise the regulatory authority of administrative agen-\ncies or other enforcers of state law directly against the\nTribe. Thus, Texas correctly explains that its Lottery Com-\nmission could not exercise \u201cjurisdiction on the Tribe\u2019s reser-\nvation.\u201d Brief for Respondent 38. Likewise, its \u201clocal dis-\ntrict attorneys\u201d could not bring \u201ccriminal enforcement\nactions against the Pueblo in state court for violations of\nwhat has been adopted as federal law.\u201d Id., at 38\u201339. Yet\nas \u00a7107(a) demands, the substance of the State\u2019s laws pro-\nhibiting certain gaming activities would remain enforceable\nin full.\n\f16           YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

Texas objected that granting this\nstatus might bring with it casino-style gaming. Categori-\ncally denying any interest in gaming, the Tribe requested\nthat the pending bill conferring federal trust status be\namended to prohibit on the reservation all gambling as de-\nfined by Texas law. The Tribe did so even though it\nacknowledged this would result in it being treated differ-\nently from other tribes. The proposal removed the State\u2019s\nobjection and Congress passed the bill granting federal\ntrust status to the Tribe, while\u2014in \u00a7107(a)\u2014specifically\nprohibiting on the reservation gaming activities barred un-\nder Texas law. At the same time, in \u00a7107(b), Congress pro-\ntected the Tribe\u2019s interests by banning direct state enforce-\nment on the reservation. Under \u00a7107(c), Texas would\ninstead have to proceed in federal court. This was a careful\nbalance struck by Congress.\n   The Court today throws out that balance, treating gam-\ning on this reservation as if it were just like any other Pub-\nlic Law 280 reservation.

In 1983,\n  Texas renounced its trust responsibilities as inconsistent with the\n  State\u2019s Constitution. The State also expressed opposition to any new\n  federal trust legislation that did not permit the State to apply its own\n  gaming laws on tribal lands. Congress restored the Tribe\u2019s federal\n  trust status in 1987 when it adopted the Ysleta del Sur and Alabama\n  and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">101 Stat. 666</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n  The Restoration Act also \u201cprohibited\u201d as a matter of federal law \u201c[a]ll\n  gaming activities which are prohibited by the laws of the State of\n  Texas.\u201d Id., at 668. Shortly thereafter, Congress adopted its own com-\n  prehensive Indian gaming legislation: the Indian Gaming Regulatory\n  Act (IGRA). IGRA established rules for separate classes of games. As\n  relevant here, IGRA permitted Tribes to offer so-called class II\n  games\u2014like bingo\u2014in States that \u201cpermi[t] such gaming for any pur-\n  pose by any person, organization or entity.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">25 U.

Texas refused, arguing that the Resto-\n  ration Act displaced IGRA and required the Tribe to follow all of the\n  State\u2019s gaming laws on tribal lands.

In 2016, the Tribe began to offer bingo, including \u201celec-\n    tronic bingo\u201d machines, on the view that IGRA treats bingo as a class\n    II game for which no state permission is required so long as the State\n    permits the game to be played on some terms by some persons. The\n    State then sought to shut down all of the Tribe\u2019s bingo operations.\n    Bound by Ysleta I, the District Court sided with Texas and enjoined\n    the Tribe\u2019s bingo operations, but the court stayed the injunction pend-\n    ing appeal. The Fifth Circuit reaffirmed Ysleta I and held that the\n    Tribe\u2019s bingo operations were impermissible because they did not con-\n    form to Texas\u2019s bingo regulations.\nHeld: The Restoration Act bans as a matter of federal law on tribal lands\n only those gaming activities also banned in Texas. Pp. 8\u201320.\n    (a) Section 107 of the Restoration Act directly addresses gaming on\n the lands of the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo. It provides in subsection (a)\n that \u201cgaming activities which are prohibited by [Texas law] are hereby\n prohibited on the reservation and on lands of the tribe.\u201d Subsection\n (b) insists that the statute does not grant Texas \u201ccivil or criminal reg-\n ulatory jurisdiction\u201d with respect to matters covered by \u00a7107. The\n State reads the Act as effectively subjecting the Tribe to the entire\n body of Texas gaming laws and regulations. The Tribe, however, un-\n derstands the Act to bar it from offering only those gaming activities\n the State fully prohibits, and that if Texas merely regulates bingo, the\n Tribe may also offer that game subject only to federal-law, not state-\n law, limitations.\n    The language of \u00a7107\u2014particularly its dichotomy between prohibi-\n tion and regulation\u2014presents Texas with a problem. Texas concedes\n that its laws do not \u201cforbid,\u201d \u201cprevent,\u201d \u201ceffectively stop,\u201d or \u201cmake im-\n possible\u201d bingo operations in the State. Webster\u2019s Third International\n Dictionary 1813 (defining \u201cprohibit\u201d). Instead, the State admits that\n it allows the game \u201caccording to rule[s]\u201d that \u201cfix the time,\u201d place, and\n manner in which it may be conducted. Id., at 1913 (defining \u201cregu-\n late\u201d). From this alone, Texas\u2019s bingo laws appear to fall on the regu-\n latory rather than prohibitory side of the line. In response, Texas de-\n scribes its laws as \u201cprohibiting\u201d bingo unless the State\u2019s regulations\n are followed and insists that it is merely seeking to do what subsection\n (a) allows.\n    Texas\u2019s understanding of the word \u201cprohibit\u201d would risk turning the\n Restoration Act\u2019s terms into an indeterminate mess. In Texas\u2019s view,\n laws regulating gaming activities become laws prohibiting gaming ac-\n tivities\u2014an interpretation that violates the rule against \u201cascribing to\n one word a meaning so broad\u201d that it assumes the same meaning as\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U.

In that referenced\n    resolution, the Tribe announced its opposition to Texas\u2019s legislative ef-\n    forts to have its gaming laws apply on tribal lands. At the same time,\n    the Tribe also announced its own intention to prohibit gaming on its\n    reservation and authorized the acceptance of federal legislation pro-\n    hibiting gaming on tribal lands. Texas claims that the reference to the\n    tribal resolution suggests the Restoration Act should be read \u201cbroadly\u201d\n    to allow Texas to apply its gaming regulations on tribal lands. As an\n    initial matter, subsection (a) does not purport to incorporate that res-\n    olution into federal law\u2014something Congress knows how to do when\n    it wishes, see e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">25 U. S. C. \u00a75396</span><pre class=\"inline\">(b). In addition, Texas\u2019s \u201cbroad\u201d\n    reading suffers from the same interpretative challenges already men-\n    tioned and defies Congress\u2019s apparent adoption of Cabazon\u2019s prohibi-\n    tory/regulatory distinction. Finally, on this Court\u2019s interpretation of\n    the Restoration Act, Congress did legislate \u201cin accordance with\u201d the\n    Tribe\u2019s resolution by expressly granting the Tribe federal recognition\n    and choosing not to apply Texas gaming regulations as surrogate fed-\n    eral law on tribal land. Pp. 15\u201318.\n         (2) Texas appeals to public policy and argues that attempts to dis-\n    tinguish between prohibition and regulation are sure to prove \u201cun-\n    workable.\u201d It is not, however, this Court\u2019s place to question whether\n    Congress adopted the wisest or most workable policy. That the Resto-\n    ration Act\u2019s prohibitory/regulatory distinction can and will generate\n    borderline cases hardly makes it unique among federal statutes. And\n    courts have applied the same prohibitory/regulatory framework for\n    decades under Public Law 280. Moreover, Texas\u2019s alternative inter-\n    pretation poses its own \u201cworkability\u201d challenges, as federal courts\n    would be charged with enforcing the minutiae of state gaming regula-\n    tions governing the conduct of permissible games.

The Tribe\ntraces its roots back to the 1680 Pueblo Revolt against the\nSpanish in New Mexico. In the revolt\u2019s aftermath, the\nSpanish retreated from Santa Fe to El Paso, and a large\nnumber of Ysleta Pueblo Indians accompanied them.\nS. Rep. No. 100\u201390, p. 6 (1987) (Senate Report); W. Tim-\nmons, El Paso 18 (1990) (Timmons). Soon, tribal members\nbuilt the Ysleta Mission, the oldest church in Texas, and in\n1751 Spain granted 23,000 acres to the Tribe for its home-\nland. See Senate Report 6\u20137; Timmons 36.\n  Things changed for the Tribe after Texas gained state-\nhood in 1845. The State disregarded Spain\u2019s land grant and\nbegan incorporating a town on tribal lands and issuing land\npatents to non-Indians. Senate Report 6\u20137.

That year, Texas\nrenounced its trust responsibilities, asserting that they\nwere inconsistent with the State\u2019s Constitution. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2019\nWL 639971</span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1 (WD Tex., Feb. 14, 2019). The Tribe re-\nsponded to this development by seeking new congressional\nlegislation to reestablish its trust relationship with the fed-\neral government. But that effort quickly became bogged\ndown in a dispute. Of all things, it concerned bingo. Texas,\nit seems, worried that allowing tribal gaming would have a\ndetrimental effect on \u201cexisting charitable bingo operations\nin the State of Texas.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 121. And be-\ncause Texas judged that its laws would be inapplicable on\ntribal lands without federal approval, the State opposed\nany new federal trust legislation unless it included a special\nprovision permitting it to apply its own gaming laws on the\nTribe\u2019s lands. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">ibid.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n                              B\n   Years of negotiations ensued. But one development dur-\ning this period turned out to have particular salience even\nthough it did not immediately concern either the Tribe or\nTexas. In February 1987, this Court issued California v.\nCabazon Band of Mission Indians, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111828\"><a href=\"/opinion/111828/california-v-cabazon-band-of-mission-indians/\">480 U.

In it, the\nCourt addressed Public Law 280, a statute Congress had\nadopted in 1953 to allow a handful of States to enforce some\nof their criminal\u2014but not certain of their civil\u2014laws on\nparticular tribal lands.

But if state\nlaws merely regulate a game\u2019s availability, the Court ruled,\nPublic Law 280 does not permit a State to enforce its rules\n\f4            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v.

Much like Texas\ntoday, California in 1987 permitted bingo in various cir-\ncumstances (including for charitable purposes), but treated\ndeviations from its rules as criminal violations.

Because Cabazon left cer-\ntain States unable to apply their gaming regulations on In-\ndian reservations, some feared the Court\u2019s decision opened\nthe door to a significant amount of new and unregulated\ngaming on tribal lands. See R. Anderson, S. Krakoff, & B.\nBerger, American Indian Law: Cases and Commentary\n479\u2013480 (4th ed. 2020) (Anderson). In 1988, Congress\nsought to fill that perceived void by adopting its own com-\nprehensive national legislation: the Indian Gaming Regu-\nlatory Act (IGRA), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">102 Stat. 2467</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">25 U. S. C. \u00a7 2701</span><pre class=\"inline\"> et seq.;\nAnderson 479\u2013482. IGRA established rules for three sepa-\nrate classes of games. Relevant here, the law permitted\nTribes to offer so-called class II games\u2014like bingo\u2014in\nStates that \u201cpermi[t] such gaming for any purpose by any\nperson, organization or entity.\u201d \u00a7 2710(b)(1)(A).

To ensure\ncompliance with the statute\u2019s terms, IGRA created the Na-\ntional Indian Gaming Commission. \u00a7 2704(a).\n                              C\n   In the 1990s, the Tribe sought to negotiate a compact\nwith Texas to offer class III games pursuant to IGRA. But\nTexas refused to come to the table. It argued that the Res-\ntoration Act displaced IGRA and required the Tribe to fol-\nlow all of the State\u2019s gaming laws on tribal lands.\n   That dispute quickly found its way to court. Initially, a\nfederal district court granted summary judgment for the\nTribe, holding that Texas violated IGRA by failing to nego-\ntiate in good faith.

In 2016, the Tribe began offering bingo. On its view,\nit was free to offer at least this game because IGRA treats\nbingo as a class II game for which no state permission is\nrequired so long as the State permits the game to be played\non some terms by some persons.

And, Texas stressed, under its\nlaws bingo remains permissible today only for charitable\npurposes and only subject to a broad array of regulations.\n  Finding itself bound by Ysleta I, the District Court sided\nwith Texas and enjoined the Tribe\u2019s bingo operations. But\nthe court also chose to stay its injunction pending appeal.\nThe court did so because it thought that either the Fifth\nCircuit or this Court might wish to reconsider Ysleta I.

After all,\nthe Restoration Act effectively federalizes only those state\nlaws that prohibit gaming activities. The statute expressly\nstates that nothing in it may be read as authorizing Texas\nto enforce criminal or civil regulations on tribal lands. And\nwhen it comes to bingo, the State permits at least some\nforms of the game subject to regulation.

The State, in its only argument in sup-\nport of regulatory jurisdiction over the Tribe\u2019s gaming ac-\ntivities, reads the Act as effectively subjecting the Tribe to\nthe entire body of Texas gaming laws and regulations, just\nas the Fifth Circuit held in Ysleta I. The Tribe understands\nthe Act to bar it from offering only those gaming activities\nthe State fully prohibits. Consistent with Cabazon, the\nTribe submits, if Texas merely regulates a game like bingo,\nit may offer that game\u2014and it may do so subject only to the\nlimits found in federal law and its own law, not state law.\n   To resolve the parties\u2019 disagreement, we turn to \u00a7 107 of\nthe Restoration Act, where Congress directly addressed\ngaming on the Tribe\u2019s lands and said this:\n           \u201cSEC. 107. GAMING ACTIVITIES.\n(a) IN GENERAL.\u2014All gaming activities which are prohib-\nited by the laws of the State of Texas are hereby prohibited\non the reservation and on lands of the tribe. Any violation\nof the prohibition provided in this subsection shall be sub-\nject to the same civil and criminal penalties that are pro-\nvided by the laws of the State of Texas. The provisions of\nthis subsection are enacted in accordance with the tribe\u2019s\nrequest in Tribal Resolution No. T.C.\u201302\u201386 which was ap-\nproved and certified on March 12, 1986.\n(b) NO STATE REGULATORY JURISDICTION.\u2014Nothing in this\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

On the\none hand, subsection (a) says that gaming activities prohib-\nited by state law are also prohibited as a matter of federal\nlaw (using some variation of the word \u201cprohibited\u201d no fewer\nthan three times). On the other hand, subsection (b) insists\nthat the statute does not grant Texas civil or criminal reg-\nulatory jurisdiction with respect to matters covered by this\n\u201csection,\u201d a section concerned exclusively with gaming. The\nimplication that Congress drew from Cabazon and meant\nfor us to apply its same prohibitory/regulatory framework\nhere seems almost impossible to ignore. See Part II\u2013B, in-\nfra.\n   But before getting to that, we start with a careful look at\nthe statute\u2019s terms standing on their own. Often enough in\nordinary speech, to prohibit something means to \u201cforbid,\u201d\n\u201cprevent,\u201d or \u201ceffectively stop\u201d it, or \u201cmake [it] impossible.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third International Dictionary 1813 (1986)\n(Webster\u2019s Third); see 7 Oxford English Dictionary 596 (2d\ned. 1989) (OED); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1212 (6th ed. 1990)\n(Black\u2019s). Meanwhile, to regulate something is usually un-\nderstood to mean to \u201cfix the time, amount, degree, or rate\u201d\nof an activity \u201caccording to rule[s].\u201d Webster\u2019s Third 1913;\nsee 8 OED 524; Black\u2019s 1286. Frequently, then, the two\nwords are \u201cnot synonymous.\u201d Id., at 1212.\n   That fact presents Texas with a problem. The State con-\ncedes that its laws do not forbid, prevent, effectively stop,\nor make bingo impossible. Instead, the State admits that it\n\f10            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nallows the game subject to fixed rules about the time, place,\nand manner in which it may be conducted. See Brief for\nRespondent 5. From this alone, it would seem to follow that\nTexas\u2019s laws fall on the regulatory rather than prohibitory\nside of the line\u2014and thus may not be applied on tribal lands\nunder the terms of subsection (b).\n   To be sure, Texas is not without a reply. It observes that\nin everyday speech someone could describe its laws as \u201cpro-\nhibiting\u201d bingo unless the State\u2019s time, place, and manner\nregulations are followed. After all, conducting bingo or any\nother game in defiance of state regulations can lead not just\nto a civil citation, but to a criminal prosecution too. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Tex.\nOcc. Code Ann. \u00a7 2001.551</span><pre class=\"inline\">(c) (West 2019). In this sense,\nthe State submits, it seeks to do exactly what subsection (a)\nallows\u2014\u201cprohibit\u201d bingo that is not conducted for charitable\npurposes and compliant with all its state gaming regula-\ntions.\n   That much we find hard to see. Maybe in isolation or in\nanother context, Texas\u2019s understanding of the word \u201cpro-\nhibit\u201d would make sense. But here it risks rendering the\nRestoration Act a jumble. No one questions that Texas\n\u201cregulates\u201d bingo by fixing the time, place, and manner in\nwhich the game may be conducted. The State submits only\nthat, in some sense, its laws also \u201cprohibit\u201d bingo\u2014when\nthe game fails to comply with the State\u2019s time, place, and\nmanner regulations. But on that reading, the law\u2019s dichot-\nomy between prohibition and regulation collapses. Laws\nregulating gaming activities become laws prohibiting gam-\ning activities. It\u2019s an interpretation that violates our usual\nrule against \u201cascribing to one word a meaning so broad\u201d\nthat it assumes the same meaning as another statutory\nterm. Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117902\"><a href=\"/opinion/117902/gustafson-v-alloyd-co/\">513 U.

Rather than supply coherent guidance,\nTexas\u2019s reading of the law renders it an indeterminate\nmess.\n   The State\u2019s interpretation of subsection (a) presents an-\nother related problem. Suppose we could somehow overlook\nthe indeterminacy its interpretation yields and adopt the\nState\u2019s view that it may \u201cprohibit\u201d bingo under subsec-\ntion (a) not merely by outlawing bingo altogether but also\nby dictating the time, place, and manner in which it is\nplayed. On that account, subsection (b) would be left with\nno work to perform, its terms dead letters all. Yes, subsec-\ntion (b) says that it does not federalize Texas\u2019s civil and\ncriminal gaming regulations on tribal land. But, the State\neffectively suggests, we should turn a blind eye to all that.\nIt\u2019s a result that defies yet another of our longstanding can-\nons of statutory construction\u2014this one, the rule that we\nmust normally seek to construe Congress\u2019s work \u201cso that\neffect is given to all provisions, so that no part will be inop-\nerative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\u201d Corley v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145888\"><a href=\"/opinion/145888/corley-v-united-states/\">556 U. S. 303</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314 (2009) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Seeking a way around these problems, Texas only stum-\nbles on another. The State submits that subsection (b) per-\nforms real work even on its reading by denying its courts\nand gaming commission \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to punish violations\nof subsection (a) and sending disputes over \u201cregulatory\u201d vi-\nolations to federal court instead. The dissent also embraces\nthis approach. See post, at 14\u201315. But this understanding\nof subsection (b) only serves to render still another portion\nof the statute\u2014subsection (c)\u2014a nullity. Titled \u201cJurisdic-\ntion Over Enforcement Against Members,\u201d subsection (c)\ngrants the federal courts \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction over viola-\ntions of subsection (a), and it also permits Texas to \u201cbrin[g]\n\f12              YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v.

Put differently, subsection (c) al-\nready precludes state courts and state agencies from exer-\ncising jurisdiction over violations of subsection (a). To make\nany sense of the statute, subsection (b) must do something\nbesides repeat that work.\n   Stepping back, a full look at the statute\u2019s structure sug-\ngests a set of simple and coherent commands. In subsec-\ntion (a), Congress effectively federalized and applied to\ntribal lands those state laws that prohibit or absolutely ban\na particular gaming activity. In subsection (b), Congress\nexplained that it was not authorizing the application of\nTexas\u2019s gaming regulations on tribal lands. In subsec-\ntion (c), Congress granted federal courts jurisdiction to en-\ntertain claims by Texas that the Tribe has violated subsec-\ntion (a). Texas\u2019s competing interpretation of the law\nrenders individual statutory terms duplicative and whole\nprovisions without work to perform.1\n                               B\n     Even if fair questions remain after a look at the ordinary\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The dissent offers a surplusage argument of its own, arguing that the\n\nCourt\u2019s reading of \u00a7 107 duplicates the work done by \u00a7 105(f ). See post,\nat 12. That is mistaken. Section 105(f ) does not specifically address\ntribal gaming, but instead broadly extends Public Law 280 and its asso-\nciated jurisdictional rules to the Tribe\u2019s reservation. By contrast, \u00a7 107\nspeaks only and specifically to gaming. And while it does extend much\nof the Public Law 280 regime to tribal gaming, it also departs from that\nframework in at least two significant ways. First, \u00a7 107 incorporates\nTexas\u2019s criminal gaming prohibitions as surrogate federal law, while\nPublic Law 280 allows particular States to apply their own laws directly\nto tribal lands. Second, it establishes unique jurisdictional rules for ju-\ndicial review of alleged violations of Texas\u2019s gaming prohibitions. See\npost, at 13. Where Public Law 280 grants state courts jurisdiction over\nviolations of state criminal prohibitory laws, subsection (c) grants federal\ncourts exclusive jurisdiction over alleged violations of \u00a7 107, \u201c[n]otwith-\nstanding section 105(f ).\u201d There is no superfluity here.\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U.

Recall that Congress passed the\nAct just six months after this Court handed down Cabazon.\nSee Part I\u2013B, supra. In that decision, the Court interpreted\nPublic Law 280 to mean that only \u201cprohibitory\u201d state gam-\ning laws could be applied on the Indian lands in question,\nnot state \u201cregulatory\u201d gaming laws. The Court then pro-\nceeded to hold that California bingo laws\u2014laws materially\nidentical to the Texas bingo laws before us today\u2014fell on\nthe regulatory side of the ledger. Just like Texas today,\nCalifornia heavily regulated bingo, allowing it only in cer-\ntain circumstances (usually for charity). Just like Texas,\nCalifornia criminalized violations of its rules. Compare\nCabazon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111828\"><a href=\"/opinion/111828/california-v-cabazon-band-of-mission-indians/\">480 U.

Still, because California permitted some forms\nof bingo, the Court concluded that meant California did not\nprohibit, but only regulated, the game. Cabazon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111828\"><a href=\"/opinion/111828/california-v-cabazon-band-of-mission-indians/\">480 U. S.,\nat 211</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n   For us, that clinches the case. This Court generally as-\nsumes that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of\nthis Court\u2019s relevant precedents. See Ryan v. Valencia Gon-\nzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"814956\"><a href=\"/opinion/814956/ryan-v-valencia-gonzales/\">568 U. S. 57</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 (2013). And at the time Congress\nadopted the Restoration Act, Cabazon was not only a rele-\nvant precedent concerning Indian gaming; it was the prece-\ndent. See Part I\u2013B, supra. In Cabazon, the Court drew a\nsharp line between the terms prohibitory and regulatory\nand held that state bingo laws very much like the ones now\nbefore us qualified as regulatory rather than prohibitory in\nnature. We do not see how we might fairly read the terms\nof the Restoration Act except in the same light. After all,\n\u201c[w]hen the words of the Court are used in a later statute\ngoverning the same subject matter, it is respectful of Con-\ngress and of the Court\u2019s own processes to give the words the\nsame meaning in the absence of specific direction to the con-\ntrary.\u201d Williams v.

TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimmediate aftermath of Cabazon, Congress adopted not\njust the Restoration Act; it also adopted other laws govern-\ning tribal gaming activities. In these laws, Congress again\nappeared to reference and employ Cabazon\u2019s distinction be-\ntween prohibition and regulation\u2014and Congress did so in\nways demonstrating that it clearly understood how to grant\na State regulatory jurisdiction over a Tribe\u2019s gaming activ-\nities when it wished to do so. Cf. Lagos v. United States,\n584 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at 6\u20137).\n   Consider two examples. On the same day it passed the\nRestoration Act, Congress adopted a statute involving the\nWampanoag Tribe. But, contrary to its approach in the\nRestoration Act, Congress subjected that Tribe\u2019s lands to\n\u201cthose laws and regulations which prohibit or regulate the\nconduct of bingo or any other game of chance.\u201d Wampanoag\nTribal Council of Gay Head, Inc., Indian Claims Settlement\nAct of 1987, \u00a7 9, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">101 Stat. 709</span><pre class=\"inline\">\u2013710 (emphasis added).\nShortly after the Restoration Act, Congress adopted an-\nother statute, this one governing the Catawba Tribe\u2019s gam-\ning activities. In it, Congress provided that \u201call laws, ordi-\nnances, and regulations of the State, and its political\nsubdivisions, shall govern the regulation of . . . gambling or\nwagering by the Tribe on and off the Reservation.\u201d Ca-\ntawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina Land Claims Settle-\nment Act of 1993, \u00a7 14(b), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">107 Stat. 1136</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (emphasis added).\n   That Congress chose to use the language of Cabazon in\ndifferent ways in three statutes closely related in time and\nsubject matter seems to us too much to ignore. See State\nFarm Fire & Casualty Co. v. United States ex rel. Rigsby,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">580 U.

For two\nTribes, Congress did more than just prohibit on tribal lands\nthose gaming activities prohibited by state law. It said\nstate regulations should apply as a matter of federal law\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntoo. Yet for this Tribe Congress did something different. It\ndid not subject the Tribe to all Texas laws that \u201cprohibit or\nregulate\u201d gaming. It did not subject the Tribe to all laws\nthat \u201cgovern the regulation of gambling.\u201d Instead, Con-\ngress banned on tribal lands only those gaming activities\n\u201cprohibited\u201d by Texas, and it did not provide for state \u201creg-\nulatory jurisdiction\u201d over tribal gaming.2\n   None of this is to say that the Tribe may offer any gaming\nactivity on whatever terms it wishes. It is only to say that\nthe Fifth Circuit and Texas have erred in their understand-\ning of the Restoration Act. Under that law\u2019s terms, if a gam-\ning activity is prohibited by Texas law it is also prohibited\non tribal land as a matter of federal law. Other gaming ac-\ntivities are subject to tribal regulation and must conform\nwith the terms and conditions set forth in federal law, in-\ncluding IGRA to the extent it is applicable. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 31\u201333.3\n                             III\n                              A\n  By this point, only two arguments remain for us to con-\nsider. In the first, Texas and the dissent focus heavily on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The dissent speculates about ways Congress could have even more\n\nclearly communicated its intention to ban only those games prohibited\nby Texas. See post, at 8\u20139. But rather than compare the Restoration Act\nto hypothetical language Congress could have used, it seems more appro-\npriate to compare the Act\u2019s terms to language Congress did use in closely\nrelated statutes addressing precisely the same subject, including in one\npassed the very same day as this Act. The dissent cannot and does not\ndeny that Congress could have employed the language it used in the\nWampanoag and Catawba statutes. That Congress took a different ap-\nproach strongly suggests it had in mind a different set of rules for this\nTribe.\n   3 In reaching this conclusion, we need not rely on the rule\u2014long estab-\n\nlished by our precedents\u2014that \u201cstatutes are to be construed liberally in\nfavor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their ben-\nefit.\u201d Montana v.

On our view,\nTexas\u2019s interpretation fails even without recourse to that rule.\n\f16            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v.

In\nthe referenced 1986 resolution, the Tribe announced its op-\nposition to Texas\u2019s legislative efforts to have all its gaming\nlaws apply on tribal lands. Such a result, the resolution\nsaid, would represent \u201ca substantial infringement upon the\nTribe[\u2019s] power of self-government . . .

Before us, Texas does not question\nthat the Tribe was (and remains) free to change its own\nlaws after adopting that resolution. But, the State says, the\nfact that Congress referenced the tribal resolution in sub-\nsection (a) suggests that the Restoration Act should be read\n\u201cbroadly\u201d to allow Texas to apply its gaming regulations on\ntribal lands. Brief for Respondent 22.\n   It\u2019s an unsatisfying suggestion for at least a few reasons.\nIn the first place, while subsection (a) explains that the Res-\ntoration Act was \u201cenacted in accordance with\u201d the Tribe\u2019s\nresolution, it does not purport to incorporate that resolution\ninto federal law. Congress knows exactly how to adopt into\nfederal law the terms of another writing or resolution when\nit wishes. It can and has said, for example, that a tribal law\nor resolution \u201cshall have the same force and effect as if it\nwere set out in full in this subchapter.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7 5396</span><pre class=\"inline\">(b). But even Texas does not suggest that Congress\nwent that far in the Restoration Act.\n   With that possibility shelved, it is hard to see what\u2019s left.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nTexas suggests that Congress\u2019s reference to the tribal reso-\nlution at least augurs in favor of a \u201cbroa[d]\u201d reading of sub-\nsection (a). Brief for Respondent 22; see also post, at 9\u201310.\nBut saying that tells us nothing about how much broader\nthe law should be read. And, as we have seen, the only\n\u201cbroader\u201d reading of subsection (a) Texas offers faces its\nchallenges\u2014 it requires us to believe that subsection (a)\nswallows subsection (b) whole, makes a nullity of subsection\n(c), and defies Congress\u2019s apparent adoption of Cabazon\u2019s\nprohibitory/regulatory distinction.\n   There is still another and maybe more fundamental prob-\nlem here. On our interpretation of the Restoration Act,\nCongress did legislate \u201cin accordance with\u201d the Tribe\u2019s res-\nolution: It expressly granted the Tribe federal recognition\nand chose not to apply Texas gaming regulations as surro-\ngate federal law on tribal land. Of course, Congress also\nsought to act in accordance with at least some of Texas\u2019s\nconcerns by banning those games fully barred by Texas law.\nIn the end, it seems each got half a loaf.\n   By contrast, adopting Texas\u2019s alternative interpretation\nof the Restoration Act would make a mockery of Congress\u2019s\nstatement that it sought to act \u201cin accordance with\u201d the\nTribe\u2019s resolution. On the State\u2019s view, all of its gaming\nregulations serve as surrogate federal law applicable on\ntribal lands. That\u2019s a result few would dare to describe as\n\u201caccord[ing] with\u201d the tribal resolution. In fact, it\u2019s an out-\ncome more nearly the opposite of what the Tribe sought and\ncloser to what it described as a \u201cwholly unsatisfactory . . .\ninfringement upon the Tribe[\u2019s] power of self government\u201d\nand \u201c[i]nconsistent with the central purposes of restoration\nof the federal trust relationship.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 122.\n   To be sure and as Texas and the dissent both highlight,\nthe statutory terms Congress finally settled on were in\nsome respects more generous to the Tribe than those its res-\nolution authorized tribal negotiators in Washington to ac-\ncept. Rather than ban all gaming on tribal lands, Congress\n\f18               YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nbanned only those games forbidden in Texas. But this de-\nvelopment is hardly surprising either. The Tribe adopted\nits resolution in 1986 in connection with negotiations over\na bill that eventually died in the Senate. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 3\u20134, 30. As talks continued\nthe following year, this Court issued Cabazon.

The dissent omits these es-\nsential details from its account of how the Restoration Act\nbecame law. See post, at 3. That omission leads the dissent\nto overlook one plausible explanation for why the Tribe got\nthe deal it did. It may be that, thanks to Cabazon, the\nTribe\u2019s representatives were able to persuade Congress to\nimpose a less draconian ban\u2014one that paralleled the terms\nthis Court in Cabazon found applicable to many other\nTribes under Public Law 280. Surely, too, as we have seen,\nif Congress had intended a more complete federal ban, it\ncould have easily said so. Not by obliquely referencing a\ntribal resolution, but by saying so clearly, just as it did for\nboth the Wampanoag and Catawba Tribes. See Part II\u2013B,\nsupra.4\n                             B\n  In the end, Texas retreats to the usual redoubt of failing\nstatutory interpretation arguments: an unadorned appeal\nto public policy.

And it chides the Court for con-\nsulting \u201cexcerpts from the Resolution\u2019s preamble\u201d that complicate the\ndissent\u2019s narrative. Post, at 10. But the entire document is an expression\nof the Tribe\u2019s views. If we are to rely on the resolution as a snapshot of\nthe Tribe\u2019s position, it makes little sense to ignore much of it. In any\nevent, courts regularly consult preambles and recitals even in statutes\nand contracts. See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 217\u2013220 (2012).\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Under our\nreading, Texas highlights, courts on remand might be called\non to decide whether \u201celectronic bingo\u201d qualifies as \u201cbingo\u201d\nand thus a gaming activity merely regulated by Texas, or\nwhether it constitutes an entirely different sort of gaming\nactivity absolutely banned by Texas and thus forbidden as\na matter of federal law. And, the State worries, any at-\ntempt to answer that question may require evidence, expert\ntestimony, and further litigation.\n   We appreciate these concerns, but they do not persuade\nus. Most fundamentally, they are irrelevant. It is not our\nplace to question whether Congress adopted the wisest or\nmost workable policy, only to discern and apply the policy\nit did adopt. If Texas thinks good governance requires a\ndifferent set of rules, its appeals are better directed to those\nwho make the laws than those charged with following them.\n   Even on its own terms, we are not sure what to make of\nTexas\u2019s policy argument. We do not doubt that the Resto-\nration Act\u2019s prohibitory/regulatory distinction can and will\ngenerate borderline cases. See F. Cohen, Handbook of Fed-\neral Indian Law 541\u2013544 (N. Newton ed. 2012). It may even\nbe that electronic bingo will prove such a case. But if ap-\nplying the Act\u2019s terms poses challenges, that hardly makes\nit unique among federal statutes. Nor is the line the Resto-\nration Act asks us to enforce quite as unusual as Texas sug-\ngests. Courts have applied the same prohibitory/regulatory\nframework elsewhere in this country under Public Law 280\nfor decades.

Why some-\nthing like the Cabazon test can work for one Tribe in Texas\nbut not another is not exactly obvious.\n   For that matter, Texas\u2019s alternative interpretation poses\nits own \u201cworkability\u201d challenges. Under the State\u2019s read-\ning, subsection (c) does not just charge federal courts with\nenforcing on tribal lands a federal law banning gaming ac-\ntivities also banned by state law. It also charges federal\ncourts with enforcing the minutiae of state gaming regula-\ntions governing the conduct of permissible games\u2014a role\nusually played by state gaming commissions or the Na-\ntional Indian Gaming Commission. It\u2019s a highly unusual\nrole for federal courts to assume. But on Texas\u2019s view, it\u2019s\na role federal courts must assume, as indeed they have\nsought to do since Ysleta I. And far from yielding an easily\nadministrable regime, by almost anyone\u2019s account that pro-\nject has engendered a quarter century of confusion and dis-\npute.

The Fifth Circuit took the same\nview in Ysleta I and in the proceedings below. That under-\nstanding of the law is mistaken. The Restoration Act bans\nas a matter of federal law on tribal lands only those gaming\nactivities also banned in Texas. To allow the Fifth Circuit\nto revise its precedent and reconsider this case in the cor-\nrect light, its judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                 So ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

The Tribe now\nwishes to engage in various high-stakes gaming activities\nthat would clearly violate Texas law\u2014if Texas law applies.\nThe question presented in this case is whether all of Texas\u2019s\ngaming laws apply on tribal land, or only those laws that\ncategorically ban a particular game.\n   The Court today concludes that the latter reading of the\nstatute is the better one. I disagree. A straightforward\nreading of the statute\u2019s text makes clear that all gaming\nactivities prohibited in Texas are also barred on the Tribe\u2019s\nland.

This makes little sense, as the whole point of\nthe provision at issue was to further restrict gaming on the\nTribe\u2019s lands. I respectfully dissent.\n                               I\n                               A\n  The Ysleta del Sur Pueblo Tribe sits on a 100-acre reser-\nvation near El Paso, Texas. The Tribe first received federal\nrecognition in 1968. At that time, Congress simultaneously\ntransferred the United States\u2019 trust responsibilities to the\nState of Texas. See Tiwa Indians Act of 1968, Pub. L. 90\u2013\n287, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">82 Stat. 93</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Texas thereafter held the Tribe\u2019s land in\ntrust, and Texas law applied in full on the reservation.\n  The situation became tenuous, however, in 1983. That\nyear Texas\u2019s Attorney General issued an opinion concluding\nthat the State\u2019s trust relationship with a similarly situated\nTribe violated the Texas Constitution. This led to a great\ndeal of uncertainty about the Pueblo\u2019s future. Efforts began\nto establish, for the first time, a direct trust relationship\nbetween the Tribe and the Federal Government. But a key\nsticking point soon emerged: the status of gaming on the\nreservation.\n  Texas has long maintained strict controls on gambling.\nIndeed, since 1876 the Texas Constitution has required the\nState\u2019s legislature to \u201cpass laws prohibiting\u201d such activities.\nArt. III, \u00a747; see also Fort Worth v. Rylie, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">602 S. W. 3d 459</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n460 (Tex. 2020). While the Texas Constitution now con-\ntains limited exceptions for charitable bingo and raffles, as\nwell as the State\u2019s official lottery, its ban on casino-style\ngaming remains absolute. With the Pueblo seeking federal\ntrust status, Texas officials worried that if the State\u2019s gam-\ning laws no longer applied on tribal lands, the Tribe\u2019s small\nreservation might soon become a large hub for high-stakes\ngaming.\n  In 1985, Congress considered a bill that would have\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

The bill also would\nhave authorized gaming on the Tribe\u2019s land, so long as it\noccurred \u201cpursuant to a tribal ordinance or law\u201d that had\nbeen \u201capproved by the Secretary of the Interior.\u201d H. R.\n1344, \u00a7107, 99th Cong., 1st Sess., 15. The bill passed the\nHouse of Representatives but stalled in the Senate due to\nopposition from Texas state officials and members of the\nTexas congressional delegation. They were concerned that\nthe bill \u201cdid not provide adequate protection against high\nstakes gaming operations on the Tribe\u2019s reservation.\u201d\nTexas v. Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">220 F. Supp. 2d 668</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 677\n(WD Tex. 2001).\n   In response, the Tribe adopted a resolution, which is of\ncentral importance to this case. See Tribal Resolution No.\nTC\u201302\u201386 (Mar. 12, 1986), App. to Pet. for Cert. 121\u2013124.\nThe resolution\u2019s preamble contains a series of prefatory\nclauses.

The provision has three parts. Section\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             5\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n107(a) begins with the primary rule. It states unequivocally\nthat \u201c[a]ll gaming activities which are prohibited by the\nlaws of the State of Texas are hereby prohibited on the res-\nervation and on lands of the tribe.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">101 Stat. 668</span><pre class=\"inline\">. It con-\ntinues by noting that this rule was \u201cenacted in accordance\nwith the tribe\u2019s request in Tribal Resolution No. T.C.\u201302\u2013\n86.\u201d Id., at 669.\n  The next part, \u00a7107(b), says that the section\u2019s prohibition\non gaming on the reservation should not be construed as a\n\u201cgrant of civil or criminal regulatory jurisdiction to the\nState of Texas.\u201d Ibid.\n  Finally, \u00a7107(c) clarifies how the gaming provision is to\nbe enforced: \u201cNotwithstanding section 105(f ), the courts of\nthe United States\u201d\u2014rather than Texas courts\u2014\u201cshall have\nexclusive jurisdiction over any offense in violation of\n[\u00a7107(a)].\u201d Ibid. \u201cHowever,\u201d \u00a7107(c) continues, \u201cnothing in\nthis section shall be construed as precluding the State of\nTexas from bringing an action in the courts of the United\nStates to enjoin violations of the provisions of this section.\u201d\nIbid. This means that\u2014unlike most state laws that apply\non tribal land, which Texas can directly enforce given its\nauthority under \u00a7105(f )\u2014Texas cannot directly enforce its\ngaming laws in state court. Instead, if Texas determines\nthe Tribe is conducting prohibited gaming activities, it\nmust seek relief by way of a federal-court injunction.\n                              B\n  It was not long before things wound up in federal court.\nThe Pueblo sued first.

Of course, as this opinion elsewhere makes clear, the resolu-\ntion\u2019s preamble is emphatic in expressing the Tribe\u2019s intent to prohibit\nall gaming activities and its willingness to compromise on the application\nof state gaming law in order to secure federal trust status.

J., dissenting\n\nthe statute for one main reason: It adopts the Tribe\u2019s argu-\nment that the use of the word \u201cprohibited\u201d in \u00a7107(a) im-\nplicitly incorporates the jurisdictional framework of Public\nLaw 280 and Cabazon Band.\n                                1\n    There are a number of reasons to be skeptical of this ap-\nproach. First, Congress knew how to incorporate the Public\nLaw 280 framework where it wished to do so. We know that\nbecause that is precisely what Congress did in \u00a7105(f ) of\nthe Restoration Act. There is little reason to think that\nCongress would have done so elsewhere in the very same\nAct with nothing more than a wink and a nudge.\n    Second, there is no evidence that Congress intended to\nuse the word \u201cprohibited\u201d in \u00a7107(a) as a term of art. The\nword \u201cprohibit\u201d appears thousands of times in the U. S.\nCode. See Brief for Respondent 24, n. 6. The fact that our\ndecision in Cabazon Band used this generic term to describe\nthe bounds of Public Law 280 is hardly enough to turn it\ninto a term of art with a more particularized meaning.\n    Third, the text of \u00a7107(a) of the Restoration Act bears lit-\ntle resemblance to the statutory language of Public Law\n280. Compare </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U. S. C. \u00a71162</span><pre class=\"inline\"> and </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U. S. C. \u00a71360</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (set-\nting forth provisions of Public Law 280) with \u00a7107 of the\nRestoration Act. Thus, this is not a situation where a more\nrecent enactment carries with it the \u201cold soil\u201d of a predeces-\nsor statute or rule. See F. Frankfurter, Some Reflections\non the Reading of Statutes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">47 Colum. L. Rev. 527</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537\n(1947).\n    Finally, the language used in \u00a7107 does not signal an in-\ntent to adopt Cabazon Band\u2019s unique dichotomy between\nlaws that are \u201c \u2018criminal/prohibitory\u2019 \u201d and those that are\n\u201c \u2018civil/regulatory.\u2019 \u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111828\"><a href=\"/opinion/111828/california-v-cabazon-band-of-mission-indians/\">480 U.

The Tribe points to\n\u00a7107(a)\u2019s use of the word \u201cprohibited\u201d and \u00a7107(b)\u2019s refer-\nence to the State lacking \u201cregulatory jurisdiction\u201d on tribal\nlands to suggest that only Texas\u2019s gaming laws that are\n\f12           YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v.

But\n\u00a7107(a) also says that both Texas\u2019s \u201ccivil and criminal pen-\nalties\u201d apply when the Tribe engages in prohibited gaming\nactivities. Id., at 668 (emphasis added). And \u00a7107(a) was\nenacted \u201cin accordance with\u201d the Tribal Resolution, id., at\n668\u2013669, which specifies that the Restoration Act outlaws\n\u201call gaming, gambling, lottery, or bingo, as defined by the\nlaws and administrative regulations of the State of Texas,\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 123 (emphasis added). These express\nreferences to \u201ccivil\u201d penalties and \u201cadministrative regula-\ntions\u201d make it unlikely that Congress intended to implicitly\nincorporate only Texas\u2019s gaming laws that are criminal/pro-\nhibitory. To the extent Congress legislated with Cabazon\nBand\u2019s dichotomy in mind, the crosscutting language that\nCongress used suggests it intended to incorporate both\ntypes of laws.\n                               2\n   The foregoing is confirmed by the structure of the Resto-\nration Act and its statutory history. As noted above, \u00a7105(f )\nincorporates the Public Law 280 framework. The Tribe\ndoes not dispute this. See Brief for Petitioners 26\u201327. Sec-\ntion 107(a) then provides a more specific rule for gaming\nactivities. This is thus the common case where \u201c[a] specific\nprovision\u201d\u2014\u00a7107(a)\u2014\u201ccontrols [over] one of more general\napplication.\u201d Gozlon-Peretz v.

It argues that while \u00a7105(f ) of the\nRestoration Act incorporated Public Law 280\u2019s Cabazon\nBand framework, \u00a7107(a) did so as well. See Brief for Peti-\ntioners 26\u201328. But if \u00a7105(f )\u2014and its incorporation of Cab-\nazon Band\u2014already applied to gaming activities that were\ngenerally prohibited in Texas, there would have been no\nneed for Congress to enact the more specific rule of \u00a7107(a).\nThe Tribe\u2019s proffered reading of the statute thus runs head-\nlong into the canon against surplusage.

The key roadblock\nto the Tribe obtaining federal trust status was a concern\nthat it would permit gambling. The Tribe obtained federal\ntrust status only after striking a deal on this issue. See Ys-\nleta del Sur Pueblo, 220 F. Supp. 2d, at 677. It would make\nlittle sense for Congress to have enacted \u00a7107(a)\u2019s limita-\ntions on gaming merely to duplicate the rules already set\nforth in \u00a7105(f ).

But the Court\ndoes not dispute that under its reading of the Restoration Act, \u00a7107(a)\nreadopted the substantive Cabazon Band standard already required by\n\u00a7105(f ), even though \u00a7105(f ) comes just a few sentences earlier in the\nstatute and uses distinct language not present in \u00a7107(a) to expressly\nadopt the Public Law 280 framework.\n\f14            YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO v. TEXAS\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nTexas\u2019s gaming prohibitions applied on tribal lands. But in\na universe where \u00a7107(a) bars no conduct beyond what\n\u00a7105(f ) already prohibits, it would make little sense for\nTexas to have less enforcement authority over gaming when\nthat was the only sticking point prior to passage of the Res-\ntoration Act. This is a sure-fire sign that something has\ngone badly awry in the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7107.\n   The Tribal Resolution confirms this point. The House of\nRepresentatives passed H. R. 1344 in December 1985. That\nversion of the bill already contained the pertinent language\napplying Public Law 280 to the Tribe. See H. R. 1344,\n\u00a7105(f ), 99th Cong., 1st Sess., 6. Under that regime, the\nTribe would have had the same authority that other tribes\nhad under Public Law 280 to offer games not altogether\nbanned by a State. But H. R. 1344 stalled in the Senate,\nand the Tribe adopted its resolution. The resolution made\nclear that the Tribe was offering a concession that would\nlimit its ability to offer gambling to a greater extent than\nunder H. R. 1344 and its existing incorporation of Public\nLaw 280. That is why the Tribe objected that it was being\nunfairly \u201csingl[ed] out . . . for treatment different than that\naccorded other Tribes in this country.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n123.\n   Still, the Tribe wanted\u2014and needed\u2014federal trust sta-\ntus, more than gambling. In fact, the Tribe asserted in the\npreamble to the resolution that it had \u201cno interest in con-\nducting high stakes bingo or other gambling operations\u201d\nand remained \u201cfirm in its commitment to prohibit outright\nany gambling or bingo in any form on its reservation.\u201d Id.,\nat 121, 123. Given its interest in federal trust status and\nits lack of interest in gaming, the Tribe requested that Con-\ngress \u201camend\u201d H. R. 1344 to add language banning \u201call\ngaming, gambling, lottery, or bingo\u201d on its reservation.\nIbid. Since the then-existing text of H.

Texas objected that granting this\nstatus might bring with it casino-style gaming. Categori-\ncally denying any interest in gaming, the Tribe requested\nthat the pending bill conferring federal trust status be\namended to prohibit on the reservation all gambling as de-\nfined by Texas law. The Tribe did so even though it\nacknowledged this would result in it being treated differ-\nently from other tribes. The proposal removed the State\u2019s\nobjection and Congress passed the bill granting federal\ntrust status to the Tribe, while\u2014in \u00a7107(a)\u2014specifically\nprohibiting on the reservation gaming activities barred un-\nder Texas law. At the same time, in \u00a7107(b), Congress pro-\ntected the Tribe\u2019s interests by banning direct state enforce-\nment on the reservation. Under \u00a7107(c), Texas would\ninstead have to proceed in federal court. This was a careful\nbalance struck by Congress.\n   The Court today throws out that balance, treating gam-\ning on this reservation as if it were just like any other Pub-\nlic Law 280 reservation.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 20\u20137622. Argued February 22, 2022\u2014Decided June 13, 2022\nAn officer with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs filed a criminal com-\n plaint against Merle Denezpi, a member of the Navajo Nation, charg-\n ing Denezpi with three crimes alleged to have occurred at a house lo-\n cated within the Ute Mountain Ute Reservation: assault and battery,\n in violation of 6 Ute Mountain Ute Code \u00a72; terroristic threats, in vio-\n lation of 25 CFR \u00a711.402; and false imprisonment, in violation of 25\n CFR \u00a711.404. The complaint was filed in a CFR court, a court which\n administers justice for Indian tribes in certain parts of Indian country\n \u201cwhere tribal courts have not been established.\u201d \u00a711.102. Denezpi\n pleaded guilty to the assault and battery charge and was sentenced to\n time served\u2014140 days\u2019 imprisonment. Six months later, a federal\n grand jury in the District of Colorado indicted Denezpi on one count of\n aggravated sexual abuse in Indian country, an offense covered by the\n federal Major Crimes Act. Denezpi moved to dismiss the indictment,\n arguing that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the consecutive pros-\n ecution. The District Court denied Denezpi\u2019s motion. Denezpi was\n convicted and sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. The Tenth Cir-\n cuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar successive prosecutions\n of distinct offenses arising from a single act, even if a single sovereign\n prosecutes them. Pp. 4\u201313.\n    (a) The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides:\n \u201cNo person shall . . . be subject for the same offence to be twice put in\n jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d By its terms, the Clause does not prohibit\n twice placing a person in jeopardy \u201c \u2018for the same conduct or actions,\u2019 \u201d\n Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___, but focuses on whether\n successive prosecutions are for the same \u201coffence.\u201d In 1791, \u201coffence\u201d\n meant the violation of a law. See ibid. Because the sovereign source\n\f2                     DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    of a law is an inherent and distinctive feature of the law itself, an of-\n    fense defined by one sovereign is necessarily a different offense from\n    that of another sovereign. See id., at ___. The two offenses can there-\n    fore be separately prosecuted without offending the Double Jeopardy\n    Clause\u2014even if they have identical elements and could not be sepa-\n    rately prosecuted if enacted by a single sovereign. See id., at ___, n. 1,\n    ___. This dual-sovereignty principle applies where \u201ctwo entities derive\n    their power to punish from wholly independent sources.\u201d Puerto Rico\n    v. S\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U. S. 59, 68.\n       Denezpi\u2019s single act transgressed two laws: the Ute Mountain Ute\n    Code\u2019s assault and battery ordinance and the United States Code\u2019s\n    proscription of aggravated sexual abuse in Indian country. The Ute\n    Mountain Ute Tribe exercised its \u201cunique\u201d sovereign authority in\n    adopting the tribal ordinance. See United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S.\n    313, 323. Likewise, Congress exercised the United States\u2019 sovereign\n    power in enacting the federal criminal statute. See United States v.\n    Lanza, 260 U. S. 377, 382. The two laws\u2014defined by separate sover-\n    eigns\u2014proscribe separate offenses, so Denezpi\u2019s second prosecution\n    did not place him in jeopardy again \u201cfor the same offence.\u201d Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) Denezpi argues that the dual-sovereignty doctrine applies only\n    when offenses are enacted and enforced by separate sovereigns. He\n    insists that his second prosecution violated double jeopardy, then, be-\n    cause prosecutors in CFR courts exercise federal authority, which\n    means that he was prosecuted twice by the United States. The Court\n    need not decide whether prosecutors in CFR courts exercise tribal or\n    federal authority because the Double Jeopardy Clause does not pro-\n    hibit successive prosecutions by the same sovereign; rather, it prohib-\n    its successive prosecutions \u201cfor the same offence.\u201d Thus, even if\n    Denezpi is right that the Federal Government prosecuted his tribal\n    offense, the Clause did not bar the Federal Government from prose-\n    cuting him under the Major Crimes Act too. The Double Jeopardy\n    Clause does not ask who puts a person in jeopardy. It zeroes in on\n    what the person is put in jeopardy for: the \u201coffence.\u201d The Court has\n    seen no evidence that \u201coffence\u201d was originally understood to encom-\n    pass both the violation of the law and the identity of the prosecutor.\n       Denezpi stitches together loose language from the Court\u2019s precedent\n    to support his position that the identity of the prosecuting sovereign\n    matters under the dual-sovereignty doctrine. No precedent cited by\n    Denezpi involves or even mentions the unusual situation of a single\n    sovereign successively prosecuting its own law and that of a different\n    sovereign. In any event, imprecise statements cannot overcome the\n    holdings of the Court\u2019s cases, not to mention the text of the Clause.\n    Those authorities make clear that enactment is what counts in deter-\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

Illinois, 359 U. S. 121, is misplaced. At most,\n  Bartkus acknowledged that successive federal prosecutions for the\n  same conduct would raise a double jeopardy question, but Bartkus did\n  not begin to analyze, much less answer, that question.\n     Denezpi\u2019s remaining arguments are unavailing. Denezpi first points\n  to the Government\u2019s exclusion of Major Crimes Act felonies from the\n  federal regulatory offenses enforceable in CFR court in order to avoid\n  double jeopardy concerns. He asserts that this \u201climitation borders on\n  a concession that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars [his] second prose-\n  cution.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 29. Not so. Federal regulatory crimes are\n  defined by the Federal Government, so successive prosecutions for a\n  federal regulatory crime and a federal statutory crime present a dif-\n  ferent double jeopardy question from the one here.\n     Next, Denezpi argues that permitting successive prosecutions like\n  his \u201cdoes not further the purposes underlying the dual-sovereignty\n  doctrine,\u201d namely, advancing sovereigns\u2019 independent interests. Id.,\n  at 28\u201329. Purposes aside, the doctrine \u201cfollows from\u201d the Clause\u2019s text,\n  which controls. Gamble, 587 U. S., at ___\u2013___. In any event, the\n  Tribe\u2019s sovereign interest is furthered when its assault and battery or-\n  dinance\u2014duly enacted by its governing body as an expression of the\n  Tribe\u2019s condemnation of that crime\u2014is enforced, regardless of who en-\n  forces it.\n     Finally, Denezpi asserts that the Court\u2019s conclusion might lead sov-\n  ereigns to assume more broadly the authority to enforce other sover-\n  eigns\u2019 criminal laws in order to get two bites at the apple. If a consti-\n  tutional barrier to such cross-enforcement exists, it does not derive\n  from the Double Jeopardy Clause.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n                                  [June 13, 2022]\n\n   JUSTICE BARRETT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Double Jeopardy Clause protects a person from being\nprosecuted twice \u201cfor the same offence.\u201d An offense defined\nby one sovereign is necessarily different from an offense de-\nfined by another, even when the offenses have identical el-\nements. Thus, a person can be successively prosecuted for\nthe two offenses without offending the Clause. We have\ndubbed this the \u201cdual-sovereignty\u201d doctrine.\n   This case presents a twist on the usual dual-sovereignty\nscenario. The mine run of these cases involves two sover-\neigns, each enforcing its own law. This case, by contrast,\narguably involves a single sovereign (the United States)\nthat enforced its own law (the Major Crimes Act) after hav-\ning separately enforced the law of another sovereign (the\nCode of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe). Petitioner contends\nthat the second prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy\nClause because the dual-sovereignty doctrine requires that\nthe offenses be both enacted and enforced by separate sov-\nereigns.\n   We disagree. By its terms, the Clause prohibits separate\nprosecutions for the same offense; it does not bar successive\nprosecutions by the same sovereign. So even assuming that\n\f2                DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioner\u2019s first prosecutor exercised federal rather than\ntribal power, the second prosecution did not violate the Con-\nstitution\u2019s guarantee against double jeopardy.\n                                I\n                               A\n   In 1882, Secretary of the Interior H. M. Teller wrote to\nhis Department\u2019s Office of Indian Affairs (now known as the\nBureau of Indian Affairs) to suggest that the Office \u201cformu-\nlate certain rules for the government of the Indians on the\nreservations.\u201d Letter to H. Price, Comm\u2019r of Indian Affairs\n(Dec. 2, 1882), in Dept. of Interior, Rules Governing the\nCourt of Indian Offenses 3\u20134 (1883). In response, the Com-\nmissioner of Indian Affairs adopted regulations prohibiting\ncertain acts and directing that a \u201cCourt of Indian Offenses\u201d\nbe established for nearly every Indian tribe or group of\ntribes to adjudicate rule violations. Id., at 5. Given their\nbasis in what is now the Code of Federal Regulations, the\ncourts are sometimes called CFR courts.\n   Today, most tribes have established their own judicial\nsystems, thereby displacing the CFR courts. See 25 CFR\n\u00a711.104 (2021). But some tribes, often due to resource con-\nstraints, have not. Five CFR courts remain, serving 16 of\nthe more than 500 federally recognized tribes. Their stated\npurpose is \u201cto provide adequate machinery for the admin-\nistration of justice for Indian tribes\u201d in certain parts of In-\ndian country \u201cwhere tribal courts have not been estab-\nlished.\u201d \u00a711.102. The Department\u2019s Assistant Secretary for\nIndian Affairs appoints CFR court judges, called magis-\ntrates, subject to a confirmation vote by the governing body\nof the tribe that the court serves. \u00a711.201(a).

See\n\u00a711.114. First, federal regulations set forth a list of offenses\nthat may be enforced in CFR court. See \u00a7\u00a711.400\u201311.454.\nIn addition, a tribe\u2019s governing body may enact ordinances\nthat, when approved by the Assistant Secretary, are en-\nforceable in CFR court and supersede any conflicting fed-\neral regulations. \u00a7\u00a711.108, 11.449.\n                                B\n   The reservation of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe spans\nover 500,000 acres in southwestern Colorado, northern\nNew Mexico, and southeastern Utah. The Tribe has more\nthan 2,000 members. It has not created its own court sys-\ntem, so it makes use of the Southwest Region CFR Court.\nThe Tribe has, however, adopted its own penal code, which\nis enforceable in that court.\n   A violation of the tribal code lies at the heart of this case.\nMerle Denezpi and V. Y., both members of the Navajo Na-\ntion, traveled to Towaoc, Colorado, a town within the Ute\nMountain Ute Reservation. While the two were alone at a\nhouse belonging to Denezpi\u2019s friend, Denezpi barricaded the\ndoor, threatened V. Y., and forced her to have sex with him.\nAfter Denezpi fell asleep, V. Y. escaped from the house and\nreported Denezpi to tribal authorities.\n   An officer with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs filed\na criminal complaint in CFR court. That complaint charged\nDenezpi with three crimes: assault and battery, in violation\nof 6 Ute Mountain Ute Code \u00a72 (1988); terroristic threats,\nin violation of 25 CFR \u00a711.402; and false imprisonment, in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The CFR court at issue in this case serves only the Ute Mountain Ute\n\nTribe. Some CFR courts, however, serve multiple tribes. In that event,\nthe governing bodies of all affected tribes participate in the confirmation\nand removal of magistrates. 25 CFR \u00a7\u00a711.201(a), 11.202.\n\f4                DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nviolation of 25 CFR \u00a711.404. Denezpi pleaded guilty to the\nassault and battery charge, and the prosecutor dismissed\nthe other charges. The Magistrate sentenced Denezpi to\ntime served\u2014140 days\u2019 imprisonment.\n   Six months later, a federal grand jury in the District of\nColorado indicted Denezpi on one count of aggravated sex-\nual abuse in Indian country, an offense covered by the fed-\neral Major Crimes Act. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72241(a)(1), (a)(2),\n1153(a). Denezpi moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing\nthat the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the consecutive\nprosecution, but the District Court denied the motion. After\na jury convicted Denezpi, the District Court sentenced him\nto 360 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n   The Tenth Circuit affirmed. It concluded that the second\nprosecution in federal court did not constitute double jeop-\nardy because the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe\u2019s inherent sover-\neignty was the ultimate source of power undergirding the\nearlier prosecution in CFR court. 979 F. 3d 777, 781\u2013783\n(2020).

S\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U. S. 59, 68\n(2016). The doctrine has come up most frequently in the\ncontext of the States. See, e.g., Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S.\n82, 88\u201390 (1985) (States are separate sovereigns from one\nanother); Lanza, 260 U. S., at 382 (States are separate sov-\nereigns from the United States). It applies, however, to In-\ndian tribes too.\n   United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313 (1978), is the sem-\ninal case. There, a member of the Navajo Tribe was con-\nvicted in tribal court of violating a provision of the Navajo\nTribal Code; he was later charged in federal court with vio-\nlating a federal statute based on the same underlying con-\nduct. Id., at 314\u2013316. Citing the dual-sovereignty doctrine,\nthe Court rejected Wheeler\u2019s double jeopardy argument.\n\f6               DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWe explained that before Europeans arrived on this conti-\nnent, tribes \u201cwere self-governing sovereign political com-\nmunities\u201d with \u201cthe inherent power to prescribe laws for\ntheir members and to punish infractions of those laws.\u201d Id.,\nat 322\u2013323. While \u201cCongress has in certain ways regulated\nthe manner and extent of the tribal power of self-\ngovernment,\u201d Congress did not \u201ccreat[e] \u201d that power. Id.,\nat 328. When a tribe enacts criminal laws, then, \u201cit does so\nas part of its retained sovereignty and not as an arm of the\nFederal Government.\u201d Ibid. Thus, Wheeler\u2019s prosecution\nfor a tribal offense did not bar his later prosecution for a\nfederal offense.\n  Our reasoning in Wheeler controls here. Denezpi\u2019s single\nact transgressed two laws: the Ute Mountain Ute Code\u2019s as-\nsault and battery ordinance and the United States Code\u2019s\nproscription of aggravated sexual abuse in Indian country.\nThe Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, like the Navajo Tribe in\nWheeler, exercised its \u201cunique\u201d sovereign authority in\nadopting the tribal ordinance. Id., at 323. Likewise, Con-\ngress exercised the United States\u2019 sovereign power in en-\nacting the federal criminal statute. See Lanza, 260 U. S.,\nat 382. The two laws, defined by separate sovereigns, there-\nfore proscribe separate offenses. Because Denezpi\u2019s second\nprosecution did not place him in jeopardy again \u201cfor the\nsame offence,\u201d that prosecution did not violate the Double\nJeopardy Clause.\n                              B\n   Denezpi agrees with much of this\u2014that sovereigns define\ndistinct offenses, that the Tribe and the United States are\nseparate sovereigns, and that his prosecutions involved a\ntribal offense and a federal offense respectively.

In Wheeler, the defendant was\ninitially prosecuted in a tribal court; Denezpi, by contrast,\nwas initially prosecuted in a CFR court. While tribal pros-\necutors in tribal courts indisputably exercise tribal author-\nity, Denezpi claims that prosecutors in CFR courts exercise\nfederal authority because they are subject to the control of\nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs. He concludes that he was\ntherefore prosecuted twice by the United States. And that,\nhe insists, violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because\n\u201cthe dual-sovereignty doctrine does not apply when succes-\nsive prosecutions are undertaken by a single sovereign, re-\ngardless of the source of the power to adopt the criminal\ncodes enforced in each prosecution.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 16\u2013\n17.3\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The dissent, unwilling to accept Denezpi\u2019s framing of the case, asserts\n\nthat his first conviction was for a federal offense because CFR court reg-\nulations assimilated the Tribe\u2019s assault and battery ordinance. Post, at\n6\u20139 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.). The dissent is right that we do not address\nthat point. Instead, we take the case as it comes to us: No party pressed\nthe assimilation argument, here or below, and no lower court addressed\nit. Moreover, the answer to the question is not as obvious as the dissent\nclaims. For example, while the dissent says that the relevant regulations\n\u201ccould not be plainer,\u201d post, at 6, they are much less clear than the As-\nsimilative Crimes Act, which makes a person who violates a state law on\na federal enclave situated in that State \u201cguilty of a like offense and sub-\nject to a like punishment.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a713(a). Nor, despite the dissent\u2019s\nargument to the contrary, is it dispositive that the Assistant Secretary\nmust approve a tribal ordinance before it can be enforced in CFR court\u2014\nthe Secretary of the Interior had to approve the Tribal Code at issue in\nWheeler too. 435 U. S., at 327. In short, the assimilation question is\ncomplex, making it particularly imprudent to raise and resolve it\nsua sponte as the dissent proposes to do.\n   3 At times, the dissent suggests that the source of the trial court\u2019s\n\npower, rather than (or perhaps in addition to) the source of the prosecu-\ntor\u2019s power, matters in the dual-sovereignty analysis. See post, at 10\u2013\n\f8                   DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   We need not sort out whether prosecutors in CFR courts\nexercise tribal or federal authority because we disagree\nwith Denezpi\u2019s premise. The Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot prohibit successive prosecutions by the same sovereign.\nIt prohibits successive prosecutions \u201cfor the same offence.\u201d\nAnd as we have already explained, an offense defined by\none sovereign is different from an offense defined by an-\nother. Thus, even if Denezpi is right that the Federal Gov-\nernment prosecuted his tribal offense, the Clause did not\nbar the Federal Government from prosecuting him under\nthe Major Crimes Act too.\n                               1\n  Denezpi does not even try to reconcile his position with\nthe text of the Clause. Instead, he presents the dual-\nsovereignty doctrine as \u201ca carveout to the rule against dou-\nble jeopardy\u201d and argues that the carveout does not extend\nto successive prosecutions by a single sovereign. Brief for\nPetitioner 15\u201317. But Denezpi is wrong to treat the dual-\nsovereignty doctrine as an exception to the Clause. Gamble\nwas very clear on this point: \u201cAlthough the dual-sovereignty\nrule is often dubbed an \u2018exception\u2019 to the double jeopardy\nright, it is not an exception at all. On the contrary, it fol-\nlows from the text that defines that right in the first place.\u201d\n587 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3). The Clause does not ask\nwho puts a person in jeopardy. It zeroes in on what the\nperson is put in jeopardy for: the \u201coffence.\u201d And again, in\n1791, \u201coffence\u201d meant the violation of a law. Supra, at 4\u20135.\nWe have seen no evidence that \u201coffence\u201d was originally un-\nderstood to encompass both the violation of the law and the\nidentity of the prosecutor.\n  Treating the identity of the prosecutor as part of the def-\ninition of \u201coffence\u201d is as odd as it sounds. An offense has\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n11. Again the dissent strays from Denezpi\u2019s argument, which has fo-\ncused on the source of the prosecutor\u2019s authority. See, e.g., Tr. of Oral\nArg. 9\u201311.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nalways referred to the crime itself, which is complete when\na person has carried out all of its elements. See, e.g., The\nRugen, 1 Wheat. 62, 74 (1816) (\u201c[T]he offence of trading\nwith the enemy was complete the moment the [ship] sailed\nfrom Savannah with an intention to carry her cargo to\nKingston, in Jamaica\u201d); United States v. Norris, 300 U. S.\n564, 574 (1937) (the \u201ccrime of perjury . . . is complete when\na witness\u2019s statement has once been made\u201d); Toussie v.\nUnited States, 397 U. S. 112, 117 (1970) (draft registration\n\u201cwas thought of as a single, instantaneous act to be per-\nformed at a given time, and failure to register at that time\nwas a completed criminal offense\u201d). The law has long rec-\nognized, then, that an offense is committed before it is pros-\necuted. For example, the Constitution says that \u201c[t]he Trial\nof all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State where the said\nCrimes shall have been committed.\u201d Art. III, \u00a72, cl. 3; see\nAmdt. 6 (\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall\u201d be\ntried \u201cby an impartial jury of the State and district wherein\nthe crime shall have been committed\u201d). And Sir Matthew\nHale could say of a man who breaks into a house and steals\nsomething: \u201c[I]f indicted for the burglary and acquitted, yet\nhe may be indicted of the larciny, for they are several of-\nfenses, tho committed at the same time.\u201d 2 History of the\nPleas of the Crown 245\u2013246 (1736). In addition, Chief Jus-\ntice Marshall, speaking for the Court, described a section of\nthe Crimes Act of 1790 as providing that \u201cif manslaughter\nbe committed in [certain places], the offender may be pros-\necuted in the federal Courts.\u201d United States v. Wiltberger,\n5 Wheat. 76, 98 (1820). So Denezpi\u2019s proposal would put us\nin the position of holding that a person\u2019s single act consti-\ntutes two separate offenses at the time of commission (be-\ncause the act violates two different sovereigns\u2019 laws) but\nthat those offenses later become the same offense if a single\nsovereign prosecutes both. He offers no textual justification\nfor this nonsensical result.\n\f10                  DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                               2\n   With the text against him, the best Denezpi can do is\nstitch together loose language from our precedent. For ex-\nample, we have said that \u201ctwo offenses \u2018are not the \u201csame\noffence\u201d \u2019 for double jeopardy purposes if \u2018prosecuted by dif-\nferent sovereigns.\u2019 \u201d Gamble, 587 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n2) (emphasis deleted); see Wheeler, 435 U. S., at 329\u2013330\n(\u201cSince tribal and federal prosecutions are brought by sep-\narate sovereigns, they are not \u2018for the same offence\u2019 \u201d). In\nanother case, we stated that \u201c[i]f an entity\u2019s authority to en-\nact and enforce criminal law ultimately comes from Con-\ngress, then it cannot follow a federal prosecution with its\nown.\u201d S\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U. S., at 77; see id., at 62 (\u201c[T]he\nissue is only whether the prosecutorial powers of the two\njurisdictions have independent origins\u201d). And we have re-\nmarked that \u201cthe crucial determination [under the dual-\nsovereignty doctrine] is whether the two entities that seek\nsuccessively to prosecute a defendant for the same course of\nconduct can be termed separate sovereigns.\u201d Heath, 474\nU. S., at 88.\n   Read in isolation, these statements help Denezpi\u2019s posi-\ntion that the identity of the prosecuting sovereign matters\nunder the dual-sovereignty doctrine. Read in context, their\nhelpfulness dissipates. None of these cases involves or even\nmentions the unusual situation of a single sovereign suc-\ncessively prosecuting its own law and that of a different sov-\nereign. This language appears in the context of the usual\nsituation: a sovereign (or alleged sovereign) prosecuting its\nown laws.4 Because enactment and enforcement almost al-\nways go hand in hand, it is easy to overlook that they are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In Puerto Rico v. S\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U. S. 59 (2016), Puerto Rico\n\nsought to enforce its own territorial laws; the question, which we an-\nswered in the negative, was whether Puerto Rico was an independent\nsovereign from the United States for purposes of the Clause. Id., at 65\u2013\n66; see also Waller v. Florida, 397 U. S. 387, 392\u2013395 (1970) (cities are\nnot separate sovereigns from States).\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

That is particularly good reason to\ntake the language Denezpi offers with a healthy sprinkling\nof salt. Where it was not important to attend to the differ-\nence between enactment and enforcement, it is understand-\nable why we did not. In any event, imprecise statements\ncannot overcome the holdings of our cases, not to mention\nthe text of the Clause\u2014and those authorities make clear\nthat enactment is what counts in determining whether the\ndual-sovereignty doctrine applies. See Part II\u2013A, supra.\n   Denezpi points to only one case in which the Court dealt\nwith an argument in the neighborhood of his. In Bartkus v.\nIllinois, 359 U. S. 121 (1959), the defendant argued that his\nacquittal in federal court for a federal offense barred his\nlater conviction in state court for a state offense based on\nthe same underlying conduct. There was a threshold issue\nof whether to analyze the claim under the Fifth Amend-\nment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause or the Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s Due Process Clause. The Double Jeopardy Clause\nhad not yet been incorporated against the States, but the\ndefendant argued that federal authorities had run his state\nprosecution, making it federal action to which the Clause\napplied. The Court rejected that argument, seeing no basis\nto say that \u201cIllinois in bringing its prosecution was merely\na tool of the federal authorities,\u201d rendering the \u201cstate pros-\necution . . . a sham and a cover for a federal prosecution.\u201d\nId., at 122\u2013124. That resolution meant that the Court had\nno occasion to consider whether the Double Jeopardy\nClause would have barred the Federal Government from\nseparately prosecuting Bartkus for a violation of state law.\nInstead, we considered whether Bartkus\u2019 successive federal\nand state prosecutions violated due process. See id., at 124.\n   Bartkus does not give Denezpi much to go on\u2014as Denezpi\nhimself recognizes. See Brief for Petitioner 16\u201317 (Bartkus\n\u201csuggest[s]\u201d that the dual-sovereignty doctrine will not ap-\nply if \u201ca second prosecution by an apparently separate sov-\n\f12               DENEZPI v.

At most, Bartkus acknowl-\nedged that a successive federal prosecution would raise a\ndouble jeopardy question. Yet it did not begin to analyze,\nmuch less answer, that question. In the end, then, Bartkus\nis no more help to Denezpi than the other cases on which\nhe relies.\n                               3\n   Denezpi advances a few other arguments for why the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause barred his second prosecution.\nNone succeeds.\n   First, he notes that the United States has excluded from\nthe string of federal regulatory offenses enforceable in CFR\ncourt those \u201c[f]elonies that are covered by the Major Crimes\nAct.\u201d 58 Fed. Reg. 54406 (1993). And it has done so \u201cto\navoid the possibility that someone who has committed a se-\nrious offense may be immunized from federal prosecution\n[under that Act] because of the prohibition against double\njeopardy by a prosecution in a Court of Indian Offenses.\u201d\nIbid. Denezpi asserts that this \u201climitation borders on a con-\ncession that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars [his] second\nprosecution.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 29. We disagree. Federal\nregulatory crimes are defined by the Federal Government,\nso successive prosecutions for a federal regulatory crime\nand a federal statutory crime present a different double\njeopardy question from the one presented here.\n   Next, Denezpi argues that permitting successive prosecu-\ntions like his \u201cdoes not further the purposes underlying the\ndual-sovereignty doctrine,\u201d namely, advancing sovereigns\u2019\nindependent interests. Id., at 28\u201329. Purposes aside, the\ndoctrine \u201cfollows from\u201d the Clause\u2019s text, which controls.\nGamble, 587 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 3\u20134).

Brief for Petitioner\n30\u201332. He suggests that sovereigns might more broadly as-\nsume the authority to enforce other sovereigns\u2019 criminal\nlaws in order to get two bites at the apple. But if there is a\nconstitutional barrier to such cross-enforcement, it does not\nderive from the Double Jeopardy Clause. As we have ex-\nplained, the Clause does not bar successive prosecutions of\ndistinct offenses, even if a single sovereign prosecutes them.\n                         *     *    *\n  Denezpi\u2019s single act led to separate prosecutions for vio-\nlations of a tribal ordinance and a federal statute. Because\nthe Tribe and the Federal Government are distinct sover-\neigns, those \u201coffence[s]\u201d are not \u201cthe same.\u201d Denezpi\u2019s sec-\nond prosecution therefore did not offend the Double Jeop-\nardy Clause. We affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U.

See 25 CFR \u00a7 11.202.\n                               B\n   These arrangements turned out to play a pivotal role in\nMr. Denezpi\u2019s case. In July 2017, he traveled to visit his\ngirlfriend in Towaoc, Colorado, a town within the Ute\nMountain Ute Reservation. His traveling companion, a\nwoman known as V. Y., alleged that during the visit Mr.\nDenezpi sexually assaulted her. Mr. Denezpi claimed the\nencounter was consensual. Both Mr. Denezpi and V. Y. are\nmembers of the Navajo Nation.\n   After a brief investigation, an agent of the Department of\nthe Interior swore out a criminal complaint on behalf of the\n\u201cUnited States of America, Plaintiff.\u201d App. 9\u201310. Federal\nofficials charged Mr. Denezpi with three offenses: terroris-\ntic threats, false imprisonment, and assault and battery.\nFederal regulations define the first two offenses. See\n\f4               DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\n25 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 11.402, 11.404. The third offense\u2014assault and\nbattery\u2014is an assimilated Ute Mountain Ute tribal offense\n\u201capproved\u201d by federal officials. \u00a7 11.449. Ultimately, fed-\neral authorities dismissed the first two charges and Mr.\nDenezpi pleaded no contest to the third while maintaining\nhis innocence. Pursuant to federal regulation, the court\nwas empowered to sentence Mr. Denezpi to no more than\nsix months in prison for his crime, the maximum punish-\nment the assimilated tribal law permits. Ibid. Ultimately,\nthe court sentenced him to 140 days\u2014a punishment just\nshy of the maximum.\n   After further consideration, it seems federal authorities\nmay have regretted their hasty prosecution. It seems too\nthey may have considered the punishment authorized by\ntribal law and their own regulations insufficient. Six\nmonths after Mr. Denezpi finished his Interior Department\nsentence, the Justice Department brought new charges\nagainst him for the same offense under federal statutory\nlaw. These new charges carried the potential for a much\nlonger sentence, one unconnected to tribal judgments about\nthe appropriate punishments for tribal members. See\n18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 1153(a). In time, a federal district\ncourt convicted Mr. Denezpi and sentenced him to an addi-\ntional 30 years in prison, followed by 10 years of supervised\nrelease.\n   Throughout, Mr. Denezpi has argued that the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause barred his second prosecu-\ntion. The Clause provides that no person shall be \u201ctwice put\nin jeopardy\u201d \u201cfor the same offense.\u201d Amdt. 5. No one dis-\nputes that Mr. Denezpi\u2019s first crime of conviction (assault\nand battery) is a lesser included offense of his second crime\nof conviction (aggravated sexual abuse). And no one dis-\nputes that, under our precedents, that is normally enough\nto render them the \u201csame offense\u201d and forbid a second pros-\necution. Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, 304\n(1932). Yet both the District Court and Court of Appeals\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            5\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nrejected Mr. Denezpi\u2019s argument, so he brought it here.\n                             II\n   By anyone\u2019s account, the Court of Indian Offenses is a cu-\nrious regime. When instructing agency officials to create\nthe Court of Indian Offenses, neither Secretary Teller nor\nanyone else pointed to any Act of Congress authorizing the\nproject. On the contrary, from the beginning, federal offi-\ncials recognized that these \u201c \u2018so-called courts\u2019 \u201d rested on a\n\u201cshaky legal foundation.\u201d W. Hagan, Indian Police and\nJudges: Experiments in Acculturation and Control 110\n(1966). Even more than that, one might wonder how an ex-\necutive agency can claim the exclusive power to define,\nprosecute, and judge crimes\u2014three distinct functions the\nConstitution normally reserves for three separate\nbranches. See, e.g., United States v. Brown, 381 U. S. 437,\n442\u2013443 (1965). In these proceedings, however, Mr.\nDenezpi has not questioned whether the Court of Indian Of-\nfenses is statutorily authorized. Nor has he questioned\nwhether the Constitution permits executive officials rather\nthan a judge and jury to try him for crimes. Accordingly,\nthose questions\u2014long lingering and incredibly still unan-\nswered\u2014remain for another day.\n   Focusing on Mr. Denezpi\u2019s double jeopardy claim, the\nCourt finds no constitutional violation thanks to the \u201cdual-\nsovereignty doctrine.\u201d Under that doctrine, even successive\nprosecutions under identical criminal laws may be permis-\nsible if they are \u201cbrought by different sovereigns.\u201d Puerto\nRico v. S\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U. S. 59, 66\u201367 (2016). To my\nmind, that doctrine has no place in our constitutional order.\nSee Gamble, 587 U. S., at ___ (GORSUCH, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 1). But even taking the doctrine on its own\nterms, it does not tolerate what transpired here.\n   This Court has long recognized that, unless carefully cab-\nined, the dual-sovereignty doctrine can present serious dan-\ngers. Taken to its extreme, it might allow prosecutors to\n\f6                DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\ncoordinate and treat an initial trial in one jurisdiction as a\ndress rehearsal for a second trial in another. All of which\nwould amount, in substance if not form, to successive trials\nfor the same offense. See Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S. 121,\n123\u2013124 (1959). For reasons like these, this Court has said\nrepeatedly that the doctrine applies only when two require-\nments are satisfied. First, the two prosecutions must be\nbrought under \u201cthe laws of two sovereigns.\u201d S\u00e1nchez Valle,\n579 U. S., at 67. Second, the \u201ctwo prosecuting entities\u201d must\n\u201cderive their power to punish from wholly independent [sov-\nereign] sources.\u201d Id., at 68 (emphasis added). Here, neither\ncondition is satisfied.\n                                A\n  Start with the fact that both of Mr. Denezpi\u2019s convictions\nwere for federal offenses. Almost in passing and with little\nanalysis, the Court suggests that his first conviction was for\na tribal offense and only his second involved a federal of-\nfense. Ante, at 6. But that is wrong. Mr. Denezpi\u2019s first\nprosecution in the Court of Indian Offenses was for the vio-\nlation of federal regulations that assimilated tribal law into\nfederal law.\n  The regulations could not be plainer. Subpart D of the\nregulations governing the Court of Indian Offenses is titled\n\u201cCriminal Offenses.\u201d 25 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 11.400\u201311.454. This sub-\npart contains a list of federal regulatory crimes, many of\nwhich contain enumerated elements. Nested in this list is\n\u201c\u00a7 11.449: Violation of an approved tribal ordinance.\u201d That\nregulation declares that anyone who violates a tribal ordi-\nnance \u201capproved by the Assistant Secretary [of] Indian Af-\nfairs\u201d is \u201cguilty of an offense\u201d\u2014that is, an offense under the\nInterior Department\u2019s own \u201cLaw and Order Code,\u201d Part 11.\nThe regulation further provides that anyone guilty of vio-\nlating it \u201cshall be sentenced as provided in the [tribal] ordi-\nnance.\u201d \u00a7 11.449.\n  That is exactly what happened in Mr. Denezpi\u2019s first\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            7\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nprosecution. The Ute Mountain Ute have a tribal offense of\nassault and battery. By all indications, it was \u201capproved\u201d\nby the Assistant Secretary for assimilation into federal reg-\nulations. And for this federal regulatory crime, Mr. Denezpi\nwas sentenced to a term of incarceration in a federal deten-\ntion center. On any reasonable account, Mr. Denezpi was\nnot convicted of a tribal offense. He was convicted of violat-\ning \u00a7 11.449, which assimilates federally approved tribal or-\ndinances into federal law.\n   The regulation governing the Court of Indian Offenses\u2019\ncriminal jurisdiction confirms the conclusion. It states that,\nexcept as otherwise provided, the court has jurisdiction over\n\u201cany action by an Indian . . . that is made a criminal offense\nunder this part\u201d by federal officials. \u00a7 11.114 (emphasis\nadded). The italicized language clearly refers to the list of\n\u201cCriminal Offenses\u201d in Subpart D. And predictably enough,\n\u201cthe Ute Mountain Ute Code\u2019s assault and battery ordi-\nnance\u201d is not on that list. Ante, at 6. What is on the list is\na federal regulatory crime\u2014\u201cViolation of an approved tribal\nordinance\u201d\u2014an offense that (to repeat) assimilates certain\nfederally \u201capproved\u201d tribal laws. \u00a7 11.449.\n   Historical context further indicates that Mr. Denezpi was\nprosecuted for a federal regulatory crime. As we have seen,\nthe Department of the Interior created the Court of Indian\nOffenses. And the Department wrote its own criminal code\nfor enforcement in the court. Initially, that code included\nfreestanding federal crimes outlawing everything from\n\u201cheathenish dances\u201d to \u201cconjurers\u2019 arts.\u201d 1883 Rules 3\u20137.\nOther early regulations assimilated certain state and terri-\ntorial laws into federal law and defined the punishment for\nthese crimes by reference to these local laws. See Part I\u2013A,\nsupra. As we have seen, too, federal authorities have exer-\ncised the power to revise their code from time to time. They\nhave eliminated some offenses and created others. They\nhave chosen to end the assimilation of state and territorial\noffenses and incorporate instead certain \u201capproved\u201d tribal\n\f8                DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\noffenses. Unless it should break some promise made to a\nparticular Tribe, federal authorities could close the whole\noperation tomorrow just as they chose to open it in the first\nplace.\n  Both text and context indicate that Mr. Denezpi was pros-\necuted in the Court of Indian Offenses for a federal crime,\nnot a tribal one. That is the best reading of the relevant\nregulations. Nor would the result change if there were any\nreasonable doubt, for the rule of lenity would tip the bal-\nance in Mr. Denezpi\u2019s favor. See Harrison v. Vose, 9 How.\n372, 378 (1850); Wooden v. United States, 595 U. S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2022) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment) (slip\nop., at 9\u201312).\n                               B\n   Faced with so much competing evidence, how does the\nCourt reply? It insists that United States v. Wheeler, 435\nU. S. 313 (1978), \u201ccontrols\u201d our disposition of this case,\nmandating the conclusion that Mr. Denezpi\u2019s first prosecu-\ntion was for a tribal offense, not a federal one. Ante, at 6.\n   That is mistaken. Wheeler held that, under the dual-\nsovereignty doctrine, the Double Jeopardy Clause did not\nbar federal prosecutors from pursuing a defendant after his\nconviction for an equivalent tribal offense in tribal court.\n435 U. S., at 329\u2013330. In doing so, the Court stressed that,\n\u201c[b]efore the coming of the Europeans, the tribes were self-\ngoverning sovereign political communities.\u201d Id., at 322\u2013\n323. And the Court observed that \u201cthe power to punish of-\nfenses against tribal law committed by Tribe members\u201d was\npart of inherent tribal \u201csovereignty, [which] has never been\ntaken away from [Tribes], either explicitly or implicitly, and\nis attributable in no way to any delegation to them of fed-\neral authority.\u201d Id., at 328.\n   Exactly none of that \u201ccontrols\u201d the disposition of this case.\nWheeler involved a prosecution by tribal authorities exer-\ncising their retained sovereign authority to punish tribal\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)              9\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nmembers before their own courts. It did not involve a pros-\necution by federal authorities before a federal tribunal. The\nTribe\u2019s prosecution in Wheeler was clearly for a tribal of-\nfense too\u2014contributing to the delinquency of a minor in vi-\nolation of Title 17, \u00a7 321 of the Navajo Tribal Code. See\n435 U. S., at 315\u2013316. It did not involve a federal regula-\ntion that assimilates approved tribal ordinances. What is\nmore, the Court in Wheeler expressly noted and specifically\nreserved the question presented here. It stated that it\n\u201cneed not decide\u201d whether its holding applied to the Court\nof Indian Offenses. Id., at 327, n. 26. And it reserved that\nquestion in part because it acknowledged that, unlike tribal\ncourts, the Court of Indian Offenses may be an \u201carm of the\nFederal Government.\u201d Ibid. Wheeler settles nothing.\n   Aware of the weakness of its appeal to precedent, the\nCourt ultimately retreats to another argument. It contends\nthat Mr. Denezpi has \u201cagree[d]\u201d his first conviction was for\na \u201ctribal\u201d rather than a \u201cfederal\u201d offense. See ante, at 6\u20137.\nBut if the Court intends to rely on a purported concession\nto reach its judgment in this case, lower courts and future\nlitigants should see today\u2019s decision for what it is: a one-off,\ncase-specific ruling. Whether the Court of Indian Offenses\nenforces federal regulatory offenses rather than tribal of-\nfenses remains an open question for other litigants to pre-\nserve and pursue\u2014and its answer is clear.\n                              III\n                               A\n   Proceeding further only underscores Mr. Denezpi\u2019s enti-\ntlement to relief. As this Court expressly acknowledged in\nGamble, the application of the dual-sovereignty doctrine\ndoes not turn solely on \u201cthe formal difference between two\ndistinct criminal codes.\u201d 587 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). It\nalso turns on \u201cthe substantive differences between the in-\nterests that two sovereigns can have in punishing the same\nact.\u201d Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20136). So, for example, this\n\f10               DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nCourt will find a Double Jeopardy Clause violation even if\nan individual is tried under two separate legal codes if the\ntwo prosecuting entities derive their ultimate authority\nfrom the same sovereign source. See S\u00e1nchez Valle,\n579 U. S., at 67\u201368. Likewise, if one sovereign uses an-\nother\u2019s laws as a \u201ccover\u201d or \u201csham\u201d for what in substance\namounts to its own successive prosecution, it will violate\nthe Clause. Bartkus, 359 U. S., at 123\u2013124. Really, this\naspect of our jurisprudence represents nothing more than a\nrecognition that \u201cwhat cannot be done directly cannot be\ndone indirectly. The Constitution deals with substance, not\nshadows.\u201d Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 325 (1867).\n  To honor the Double Jeopardy Clause in substance as\nwell as form, our cases indicate that we must ask, among\nother things, whether \u201cthe \u2018entities that seek successively\nto prosecute a defendant . . . [are] separate sovereigns,\u2019 \u201d\nbased on \u201cthe deepest wellsprings . . . of [their] prosecuto-\nrial authority.\u201d S\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U. S., at 67\u201368.\n\u201cWhether two prosecuting entities are dual sovereigns in\nthe double jeopardy context, we have stated, depends on\nwhether they draw their authority to punish the offender\nfrom distinct sources of power. The inquiry is thus histori-\ncal.\u201d Id., at 68 (citation and internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Under this inquiry, \u201c[i]f two entities derive their\npower to punish from wholly independent sources . . . then\nthey may bring successive prosecutions. Conversely, if\nthose entities draw their power from the same ultimate\nsource . . . then they may not.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). So, for example, this Court has held that\nsuccessive prosecutions for the same offense in a Puerto\nRico court and a federal court are barred by the Double\nJeopardy Clause because both ultimately derive their au-\nthority from Congress. Id., at 73\u201377.\n  Applying these principles here, it is clear that the deepest\nhistorical wellsprings of the Court of Indian Offenses\u2019 au-\nthority lie not in the Ute Mountain Ute or any other Tribe,\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)           11\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nbut in the halls of the Department of the Interior. As we\nhave seen, federal administrative authorities created this\ntribunal. Even today, federal officials continue to define\nand approve offenses for enforcement before it. They\namend their list of offenses from time to time. They control\nthe hiring and firing of prosecutors and magistrates. They\nopened this court; they may close it. The Court of Indian\nOffenses was and remains a federal scheme. See Part I\u2013A,\nsupra.\n   It would be deeply revisionist to suggest otherwise. Yes,\nthe federal government has now eliminated many of its reg-\nulatory crimes aimed at expunging tribal traditions. Yes,\nsome Tribes today see these courts as an alternative to cre-\nating their own tribal courts. But as the government\u2019s reg-\nulations make plain, the Court of Indian Offenses unambig-\nuously remains \u201cpart of the Federal Government.\u201d 58 Fed.\nReg. 54407. The federal government still exercises the au-\nthority to define its own offenses without reference to tribal\nlaw. And it enforces only those tribal ordinances its bureau-\ncrats approve. If the courts of Puerto Rico are properly clas-\nsified as federal under our case law, it defies the imagina-\ntion to think administrative tribunals hatched by the\nDepartment of the Interior could be treated differently.\n   The facts of this case drive the point home. Federal au-\nthorities brought charges against Mr. Denezpi in his first\nprosecution in the name of the United States. Those who\nprosecuted him were employed and controlled by the fed-\neral government. See 25 CFR \u00a7 11.204; see also Brief for\nUte Mountain Ute Tribe et al. as Amici Curiae 10. He was\nsentenced by a magistrate whom the federal government\nhad the right to appoint and remove. See 85 Fed. Reg.\n10714; 25 CFR \u00a7 11.202. And for his crime, Mr. Denezpi\nwas incarcerated in a federal detention center. Federal\nagency officials played every meaningful role in his case:\nlegislator, prosecutor, judge, and jailor.\n\f12              DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\n  There is more too. Federal authorities apparently regret-\nted their hasty first prosecution. And far from seeking to\nvindicate tribal sentencing policy, it seems they may have\nfound it wanting. So six months after the Interior Depart-\nment finished the first case, the Justice Department took\nup the second. This time federal authorities invoked fed-\neral statutes carrying exponentially longer sentences, ones\nthat care less about tribal sentencing policy for tribal mem-\nbers. Today, the federal government seeks license to follow\nthis same course in future cases too. Whether viewed his-\ntorically or through the lens of this contemporary case, the\nwellsprings here are federal through and through.\n                               B\n  Once more, the Court\u2019s reply is unpersuasive. It admits\nthat, in case after case, this Court has emphasized that the\ndual-sovereignty doctrine does not permit successive prose-\ncutions by the same sovereign. Ante, at 9\u201310. Yet the Court\ntoday tries to brush all these precedents aside, offhandedly\nsuggesting that each was mistaken. Ante, at 10. On its\ntelling, the only thing that matters is that Mr. Denezpi was\ncharged under two different sets of laws. Ibid. And here\nagain the Court proceeds on an assumption that Mr.\nDenezpi was charged first under tribal law and then under\nfederal law.\n  But the dual-sovereignty doctrine has never exalted form\nover substance in this way. If taken to its extreme, the\nCourt\u2019s reasoning could seemingly allow a State to punish\nan individual twice for identical offenses, so long as one is\nproscribed by state law and the other by federal law. It\nwould potentially allow the federal government to do the\nsame. This Court has never before endorsed such a parsi-\nmonious and easily evaded understanding of the Double\nJeopardy Clause.\n  Notice, too, what the Court does not say. In rejecting Mr.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)           13\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nDenezpi\u2019s arguments, it does not conclude that the Consti-\ntution allows successive prosecutions by one sovereign\nbased on another sovereign\u2019s laws. Instead, it holds only\nthat the \u201cconstitutional barrier to such cross-enforcement\n. . . does not derive from the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d\nAnte, at 12. The Court says nothing, for example, about\nwhether the Due Process Clauses may have something to\nsay on the subject. See Amdts. 5, 14. Under their terms,\ngovernments generally may not deprive citizens of liberty\nor property unless they do so according to \u201cthose settled us-\nages and modes of proceeding\u201d existing at common law.\nMurray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co.,\n18 How. 272, 277 (1856). And the Court points to no case\nblessing successive prosecutions by a single sovereign using\nits own and another\u2019s laws, much less any \u201csettled\u201d tradi-\ntion of doing so. So here again, the Court\u2019s decision today\nleaves much open for the future.\n                               *\n   As early as the 1890s, observers expressed concern that\nthe creation of the Court of Indian Offenses could make it\n\u201cpossible to try a man twice for the same offense,\u201d first for\na federal regulatory offense, then for a federal statutory\ncrime. Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Meeting of the\nLake Mohonk Conference 32 (1890) (statement of T. Riggs).\nAs they put it, a federal officer might \u201ctak[e] up\u201d a Native\nAmerican who might then \u201cspen[d] two or three days in the\nagency lockup\u201d pursuant to federal regulatory charges, and\n\u201cthen for the same offense [might] be brought before [a fed-\neral district] court.\u201d Ibid. Today, that pessimistic predic-\ntion has proved true. It is hard to believe this Court would\nlong tolerate a similar state of affairs in any other context\u2014\nallowing federal bureaucrats to define an offense; prose-\ncute, judge, and punish an individual for it; and then trans-\nfer the case to the resident U. S. Attorney for a second trial\nfor the same offense under federal statutory law. Still, for\n\f14              DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nover a century that regime has persisted in this country for\nNative Americans, and today the Court extends its seal of\napproval to at least one aspect of it. Worse, the Court does\nso in the name of vindicating tribal sovereign authority.\nAnte, at 6. The irony will not be lost on those whose rights\nare diminished by today\u2019s decision.

The complaint was filed in a CFR court, a court which\n administers justice for Indian tribes in certain parts of Indian country\n \u201cwhere tribal courts have not been established.\u201d \u00a711.102. Denezpi\n pleaded guilty to the assault and battery charge and was sentenced to\n time served\u2014140 days\u2019 imprisonment. Six months later, a federal\n grand jury in the District of Colorado indicted Denezpi on one count of\n aggravated sexual abuse in Indian country, an offense covered by the\n federal Major Crimes Act. Denezpi moved to dismiss the indictment,\n arguing that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the consecutive pros-\n ecution. The District Court denied Denezpi\u2019s motion. Denezpi was\n convicted and sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. The Tenth Cir-\n cuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar successive prosecutions\n of distinct offenses arising from a single act, even if a single sovereign\n prosecutes them.

The Ute\n    Mountain Ute Tribe exercised its \u201cunique\u201d sovereign authority in\n    adopting the tribal ordinance. See United States v.

The two laws\u2014defined by separate sover-\n    eigns\u2014proscribe separate offenses, so Denezpi\u2019s second prosecution\n    did not place him in jeopardy again \u201cfor the same offence.\u201d Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) Denezpi argues that the dual-sovereignty doctrine applies only\n    when offenses are enacted and enforced by separate sovereigns. He\n    insists that his second prosecution violated double jeopardy, then, be-\n    cause prosecutors in CFR courts exercise federal authority, which\n    means that he was prosecuted twice by the United States. The Court\n    need not decide whether prosecutors in CFR courts exercise tribal or\n    federal authority because the Double Jeopardy Clause does not pro-\n    hibit successive prosecutions by the same sovereign; rather, it prohib-\n    its successive prosecutions \u201cfor the same offence.\u201d Thus, even if\n    Denezpi is right that the Federal Government prosecuted his tribal\n    offense, the Clause did not bar the Federal Government from prose-\n    cuting him under the Major Crimes Act too. The Double Jeopardy\n    Clause does not ask who puts a person in jeopardy. It zeroes in on\n    what the person is put in jeopardy for: the \u201coffence.\u201d The Court has\n    seen no evidence that \u201coffence\u201d was originally understood to encom-\n    pass both the violation of the law and the identity of the prosecutor.\n       Denezpi stitches together loose language from the Court\u2019s precedent\n    to support his position that the identity of the prosecuting sovereign\n    matters under the dual-sovereignty doctrine. No precedent cited by\n    Denezpi involves or even mentions the unusual situation of a single\n    sovereign successively prosecuting its own law and that of a different\n    sovereign. In any event, imprecise statements cannot overcome the\n    holdings of the Court\u2019s cases, not to mention the text of the Clause.\n    Those authorities make clear that enactment is what counts in deter-\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

At most,\n  Bartkus acknowledged that successive federal prosecutions for the\n  same conduct would raise a double jeopardy question, but Bartkus did\n  not begin to analyze, much less answer, that question.\n     Denezpi\u2019s remaining arguments are unavailing. Denezpi first points\n  to the Government\u2019s exclusion of Major Crimes Act felonies from the\n  federal regulatory offenses enforceable in CFR court in order to avoid\n  double jeopardy concerns. He asserts that this \u201climitation borders on\n  a concession that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars [his] second prose-\n  cution.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 29. Not so. Federal regulatory crimes are\n  defined by the Federal Government, so successive prosecutions for a\n  federal regulatory crime and a federal statutory crime present a dif-\n  ferent double jeopardy question from the one here.\n     Next, Denezpi argues that permitting successive prosecutions like\n  his \u201cdoes not further the purposes underlying the dual-sovereignty\n  doctrine,\u201d namely, advancing sovereigns\u2019 independent interests. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105857\"><a href=\"/opinion/105857/bartkus-v-illinois/\">Id.,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n  at 28\u201329.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n                                  [June 13, 2022]\n\n   JUSTICE BARRETT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Double Jeopardy Clause protects a person from being\nprosecuted twice \u201cfor the same offence.\u201d An offense defined\nby one sovereign is necessarily different from an offense de-\nfined by another, even when the offenses have identical el-\nements. Thus, a person can be successively prosecuted for\nthe two offenses without offending the Clause. We have\ndubbed this the \u201cdual-sovereignty\u201d doctrine.\n   This case presents a twist on the usual dual-sovereignty\nscenario. The mine run of these cases involves two sover-\neigns, each enforcing its own law. This case, by contrast,\narguably involves a single sovereign (the United States)\nthat enforced its own law (the Major Crimes Act) after hav-\ning separately enforced the law of another sovereign (the\nCode of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe). Petitioner contends\nthat the second prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy\nClause because the dual-sovereignty doctrine requires that\nthe offenses be both enacted and enforced by separate sov-\nereigns.\n   We disagree. By its terms, the Clause prohibits separate\nprosecutions for the same offense; it does not bar successive\nprosecutions by the same sovereign. So even assuming that\n\f2                DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioner\u2019s first prosecutor exercised federal rather than\ntribal power, the second prosecution did not violate the Con-\nstitution\u2019s guarantee against double jeopardy.\n                                I\n                               A\n   In 1882, Secretary of the Interior H.

Price, Comm\u2019r of Indian Affairs\n(Dec. 2, 1882), in Dept. of Interior, Rules Governing the\nCourt of Indian Offenses 3\u20134 (1883). In response, the Com-\nmissioner of Indian Affairs adopted regulations prohibiting\ncertain acts and directing that a \u201cCourt of Indian Offenses\u201d\nbe established for nearly every Indian tribe or group of\ntribes to adjudicate rule violations. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id., at 5</span><pre class=\"inline\">.

See\n\u00a711.114. First, federal regulations set forth a list of offenses\nthat may be enforced in CFR court. See \u00a7\u00a711.400\u201311.454.\nIn addition, a tribe\u2019s governing body may enact ordinances\nthat, when approved by the Assistant Secretary, are en-\nforceable in CFR court and supersede any conflicting fed-\neral regulations. \u00a7\u00a711.108, 11.449.\n                                B\n   The reservation of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe spans\nover 500,000 acres in southwestern Colorado, northern\nNew Mexico, and southeastern Utah. The Tribe has more\nthan 2,000 members. It has not created its own court sys-\ntem, so it makes use of the Southwest Region CFR Court.\nThe Tribe has, however, adopted its own penal code, which\nis enforceable in that court.\n   A violation of the tribal code lies at the heart of this case.\nMerle Denezpi and V. Y., both members of the Navajo Na-\ntion, traveled to Towaoc, Colorado, a town within the Ute\nMountain Ute Reservation. While the two were alone at a\nhouse belonging to Denezpi\u2019s friend, Denezpi barricaded the\ndoor, threatened V. Y., and forced her to have sex with him.\nAfter Denezpi fell asleep, V. Y. escaped from the house and\nreported Denezpi to tribal authorities.\n   An officer with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs filed\na criminal complaint in CFR court. That complaint charged\nDenezpi with three crimes: assault and battery, in violation\nof 6 Ute Mountain Ute Code \u00a72 (1988); terroristic threats,\nin violation of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">25 CFR \u00a711.402</span><pre class=\"inline\">; and false imprisonment, in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The CFR court at issue in this case serves only the Ute Mountain Ute\n\nTribe.

Denezpi pleaded guilty to the\nassault and battery charge, and the prosecutor dismissed\nthe other charges. The Magistrate sentenced Denezpi to\ntime served\u2014140 days\u2019 imprisonment.\n   Six months later, a federal grand jury in the District of\nColorado indicted Denezpi on one count of aggravated sex-\nual abuse in Indian country, an offense covered by the fed-\neral Major Crimes Act. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.

Denezpi moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing\nthat the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the consecutive\nprosecution, but the District Court denied the motion. After\na jury convicted Denezpi, the District Court sentenced him\nto 360 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n   The Tenth Circuit affirmed. It concluded that the second\nprosecution in federal court did not constitute double jeop-\nardy because the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe\u2019s inherent sover-\neignty was the ultimate source of power undergirding the\nearlier prosecution in CFR court. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">979 F. 3d 777</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 781\u2013783\n(2020).

In Wheeler, the defendant was\ninitially prosecuted in a tribal court; Denezpi, by contrast,\nwas initially prosecuted in a CFR court. While tribal pros-\necutors in tribal courts indisputably exercise tribal author-\nity, Denezpi claims that prosecutors in CFR courts exercise\nfederal authority because they are subject to the control of\nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs. He concludes that he was\ntherefore prosecuted twice by the United States. And that,\nhe insists, violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because\n\u201cthe dual-sovereignty doctrine does not apply when succes-\nsive prosecutions are undertaken by a single sovereign, re-\ngardless of the source of the power to adopt the criminal\ncodes enforced in each prosecution.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 16\u2013\n17.3\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The dissent, unwilling to accept Denezpi\u2019s framing of the case, asserts\n\nthat his first conviction was for a federal offense because CFR court reg-\nulations assimilated the Tribe\u2019s assault and battery ordinance.

Instead, we take the case as it comes to us: No party pressed\nthe assimilation argument, here or below, and no lower court addressed\nit. Moreover, the answer to the question is not as obvious as the dissent\nclaims. For example, while the dissent says that the relevant regulations\n\u201ccould not be plainer,\u201d post, at 6, they are much less clear than the As-\nsimilative Crimes Act, which makes a person who violates a state law on\na federal enclave situated in that State \u201cguilty of a like offense and sub-\nject to a like punishment.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.

In short, the assimilation question is\ncomplex, making it particularly imprudent to raise and resolve it\nsua sponte as the dissent proposes to do.\n   3 At times, the dissent suggests that the source of the trial court\u2019s\n\npower, rather than (or perhaps in addition to) the source of the prosecu-\ntor\u2019s power, matters in the dual-sovereignty analysis.

UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   We need not sort out whether prosecutors in CFR courts\nexercise tribal or federal authority because we disagree\nwith Denezpi\u2019s premise. The Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot prohibit successive prosecutions by the same sovereign.\nIt prohibits successive prosecutions \u201cfor the same offence.\u201d\nAnd as we have already explained, an offense defined by\none sovereign is different from an offense defined by an-\nother. Thus, even if Denezpi is right that the Federal Gov-\nernment prosecuted his tribal offense, the Clause did not\nbar the Federal Government from prosecuting him under\nthe Major Crimes Act too.\n                               1\n  Denezpi does not even try to reconcile his position with\nthe text of the Clause. Instead, he presents the dual-\nsovereignty doctrine as \u201ca carveout to the rule against dou-\nble jeopardy\u201d and argues that the carveout does not extend\nto successive prosecutions by a single sovereign. Brief for\nPetitioner 15\u201317. But Denezpi is wrong to treat the dual-\nsovereignty doctrine as an exception to the Clause. Gamble\nwas very clear on this point: \u201cAlthough the dual-sovereignty\nrule is often dubbed an \u2018exception\u2019 to the double jeopardy\nright, it is not an exception at all. On the contrary, it fol-\nlows from the text that defines that right in the first place.\u201d\n587 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3). The Clause does not ask\nwho puts a person in jeopardy. It zeroes in on what the\nperson is put in jeopardy for: the \u201coffence.\u201d And again, in\n1791, \u201coffence\u201d meant the violation of a law. Supra, at 4\u20135.\nWe have seen no evidence that \u201coffence\u201d was originally un-\nderstood to encompass both the violation of the law and the\nidentity of the prosecutor.\n  Treating the identity of the prosecutor as part of the def-\ninition of \u201coffence\u201d is as odd as it sounds. An offense has\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n11. Again the dissent strays from Denezpi\u2019s argument, which has fo-\ncused on the source of the prosecutor\u2019s authority.

So Denezpi\u2019s proposal would put us\nin the position of holding that a person\u2019s single act consti-\ntutes two separate offenses at the time of commission (be-\ncause the act violates two different sovereigns\u2019 laws) but\nthat those offenses later become the same offense if a single\nsovereign prosecutes both.

In July 2017, he traveled to visit his\ngirlfriend in Towaoc, Colorado, a town within the Ute\nMountain Ute Reservation. His traveling companion, a\nwoman known as V. Y., alleged that during the visit Mr.\nDenezpi sexually assaulted her. Mr. Denezpi claimed the\nencounter was consensual. Both Mr. Denezpi and V.

Federal\nofficials charged Mr. Denezpi with three offenses: terroris-\ntic threats, false imprisonment, and assault and battery.\nFederal regulations define the first two offenses. See\n\f4               DENEZPI v.

The third offense\u2014assault and\nbattery\u2014is an assimilated Ute Mountain Ute tribal offense\n\u201capproved\u201d by federal officials. \u00a7 11.449. Ultimately, fed-\neral authorities dismissed the first two charges and Mr.\nDenezpi pleaded no contest to the third while maintaining\nhis innocence. Pursuant to federal regulation, the court\nwas empowered to sentence Mr. Denezpi to no more than\nsix months in prison for his crime, the maximum punish-\nment the assimilated tribal law permits. Ibid. Ultimately,\nthe court sentenced him to 140 days\u2014a punishment just\nshy of the maximum.\n   After further consideration, it seems federal authorities\nmay have regretted their hasty prosecution. It seems too\nthey may have considered the punishment authorized by\ntribal law and their own regulations insufficient. Six\nmonths after Mr. Denezpi finished his Interior Department\nsentence, the Justice Department brought new charges\nagainst him for the same offense under federal statutory\nlaw. These new charges carried the potential for a much\nlonger sentence, one unconnected to tribal judgments about\nthe appropriate punishments for tribal members. See\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a), 1153(a). In time, a federal district\ncourt convicted Mr. Denezpi and sentenced him to an addi-\ntional 30 years in prison, followed by 10 years of supervised\nrelease.\n   Throughout, Mr. Denezpi has argued that the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause barred his second prosecu-\ntion. The Clause provides that no person shall be \u201ctwice put\nin jeopardy\u201d \u201cfor the same offense.\u201d Amdt. 5. No one dis-\nputes that Mr. Denezpi\u2019s first crime of conviction (assault\nand battery) is a lesser included offense of his second crime\nof conviction (aggravated sexual abuse). And no one dis-\nputes that, under our precedents, that is normally enough\nto render them the \u201csame offense\u201d and forbid a second pros-\necution. Blockburger v.

When instructing agency officials to create\nthe Court of Indian Offenses, neither Secretary Teller nor\nanyone else pointed to any Act of Congress authorizing the\nproject. On the contrary, from the beginning, federal offi-\ncials recognized that these \u201c \u2018so-called courts\u2019 \u201d rested on a\n\u201cshaky legal foundation.\u201d W. Hagan, Indian Police and\nJudges: Experiments in Acculturation and Control 110\n(1966). Even more than that, one might wonder how an ex-\necutive agency can claim the exclusive power to define,\nprosecute, and judge crimes\u2014three distinct functions the\nConstitution normally reserves for three separate\nbranches. See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107081\"><a href=\"/opinion/107081/united-states-v-brown/\">381 U. S. 437</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n442\u2013443 (1965). In these proceedings, however, Mr.\nDenezpi has not questioned whether the Court of Indian Of-\nfenses is statutorily authorized. Nor has he questioned\nwhether the Constitution permits executive officials rather\nthan a judge and jury to try him for crimes. Accordingly,\nthose questions\u2014long lingering and incredibly still unan-\nswered\u2014remain for another day.\n   Focusing on Mr. Denezpi\u2019s double jeopardy claim, the\nCourt finds no constitutional violation thanks to the \u201cdual-\nsovereignty doctrine.\u201d Under that doctrine, even successive\nprosecutions under identical criminal laws may be permis-\nsible if they are \u201cbrought by different sovereigns.\u201d Puerto\nRico v. S\u00e1nchez Valle, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">579 U. S. 59</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66\u201367 (2016). To my\nmind, that doctrine has no place in our constitutional order.\nSee Gamble, 587 U. S., at ___ (GORSUCH, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 1). But even taking the doctrine on its own\nterms, it does not tolerate what transpired here.\n   This Court has long recognized that, unless carefully cab-\nined, the dual-sovereignty doctrine can present serious dan-\ngers. Taken to its extreme, it might allow prosecutors to\n\f6                DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\ncoordinate and treat an initial trial in one jurisdiction as a\ndress rehearsal for a second trial in another. All of which\nwould amount, in substance if not form, to successive trials\nfor the same offense. See Bartkus v. Illinois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105857\"><a href=\"/opinion/105857/bartkus-v-illinois/\">359 U. S. 121</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n123\u2013124 (1959). For reasons like these, this Court has said\nrepeatedly that the doctrine applies only when two require-\nments are satisfied. First, the two prosecutions must be\nbrought under \u201cthe laws of two sovereigns.\u201d S\u00e1nchez Valle,\n579 U. S., at 67. Second, the \u201ctwo prosecuting entities\u201d must\n\u201cderive their power to punish from wholly independent [sov-\nereign] sources.\u201d Id., at 68 (emphasis added). Here, neither\ncondition is satisfied.\n                                A\n  Start with the fact that both of Mr. Denezpi\u2019s convictions\nwere for federal offenses. Almost in passing and with little\nanalysis, the Court suggests that his first conviction was for\na tribal offense and only his second involved a federal of-\nfense. Ante, at 6. But that is wrong. Mr. Denezpi\u2019s first\nprosecution in the Court of Indian Offenses was for the vio-\nlation of federal regulations that assimilated tribal law into\nfederal law.\n  The regulations could not be plainer. Subpart D of the\nregulations governing the Court of Indian Offenses is titled\n\u201cCriminal Offenses.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">25 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 11.400</span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201311.454. This sub-\npart contains a list of federal regulatory crimes, many of\nwhich contain enumerated elements. Nested in this list is\n\u201c\u00a7 11.449: Violation of an approved tribal ordinance.\u201d That\nregulation declares that anyone who violates a tribal ordi-\nnance \u201capproved by the Assistant Secretary [of] Indian Af-\nfairs\u201d is \u201cguilty of an offense\u201d\u2014that is, an offense under the\nInterior Department\u2019s own \u201cLaw and Order Code,\u201d Part 11.\nThe regulation further provides that anyone guilty of vio-\nlating it \u201cshall be sentenced as provided in the [tribal] ordi-\nnance.\u201d \u00a7 11.449.\n  That is exactly what happened in Mr. Denezpi\u2019s first\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

By all indications, it was \u201capproved\u201d\nby the Assistant Secretary for assimilation into federal reg-\nulations. And for this federal regulatory crime, Mr. Denezpi\nwas sentenced to a term of incarceration in a federal deten-\ntion center. On any reasonable account, Mr. Denezpi was\nnot convicted of a tribal offense. He was convicted of violat-\ning \u00a7 11.449, which assimilates federally approved tribal or-\ndinances into federal law.\n   The regulation governing the Court of Indian Offenses\u2019\ncriminal jurisdiction confirms the conclusion. It states that,\nexcept as otherwise provided, the court has jurisdiction over\n\u201cany action by an Indian . . . that is made a criminal offense\nunder this part\u201d by federal officials. \u00a7 11.114 (emphasis\nadded). The italicized language clearly refers to the list of\n\u201cCriminal Offenses\u201d in Subpart D. And predictably enough,\n\u201cthe Ute Mountain Ute Code\u2019s assault and battery ordi-\nnance\u201d is not on that list. Ante, at 6. What is on the list is\na federal regulatory crime\u2014\u201cViolation of an approved tribal\nordinance\u201d\u2014an offense that (to repeat) assimilates certain\nfederally \u201capproved\u201d tribal laws. \u00a7 11.449.\n   Historical context further indicates that Mr. Denezpi was\nprosecuted for a federal regulatory crime. As we have seen,\nthe Department of the Interior created the Court of Indian\nOffenses. And the Department wrote its own criminal code\nfor enforcement in the court. Initially, that code included\nfreestanding federal crimes outlawing everything from\n\u201cheathenish dances\u201d to \u201cconjurers\u2019 arts.\u201d 1883 Rules 3\u20137.\nOther early regulations assimilated certain state and terri-\ntorial laws into federal law and defined the punishment for\nthese crimes by reference to these local laws. See Part I\u2013A,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111541\"><a href=\"/opinion/111541/heath-v-alabama/\">supra.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> As we have seen, too, federal authorities have exer-\ncised the power to revise their code from time to time. They\nhave eliminated some offenses and created others. They\nhave chosen to end the assimilation of state and territorial\noffenses and incorporate instead certain \u201capproved\u201d tribal\n\f8                DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\noffenses. Unless it should break some promise made to a\nparticular Tribe, federal authorities could close the whole\noperation tomorrow just as they chose to open it in the first\nplace.\n  Both text and context indicate that Mr. Denezpi was pros-\necuted in the Court of Indian Offenses for a federal crime,\nnot a tribal one. That is the best reading of the relevant\nregulations. Nor would the result change if there were any\nreasonable doubt, for the rule of lenity would tip the bal-\nance in Mr. Denezpi\u2019s favor.

And the Court observed that \u201cthe power to punish of-\nfenses against tribal law committed by Tribe members\u201d was\npart of inherent tribal \u201csovereignty, [which] has never been\ntaken away from [Tribes], either explicitly or implicitly, and\nis attributable in no way to any delegation to them of fed-\neral authority.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109818\"><a href=\"/opinion/109818/united-states-v-wheeler/\">Id., at 328</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n   Exactly none of that \u201ccontrols\u201d the disposition of this case.\nWheeler involved a prosecution by tribal authorities exer-\ncising their retained sovereign authority to punish tribal\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

It did not involve a federal regula-\ntion that assimilates approved tribal ordinances. What is\nmore, the Court in Wheeler expressly noted and specifically\nreserved the question presented here.

Instead, it holds only\nthat the \u201cconstitutional barrier to such cross-enforcement\n. . . does not derive from the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d\nAnte, at 12. The Court says nothing, for example, about\nwhether the Due Process Clauses may have something to\nsay on the subject. See Amdts. 5, 14. Under their terms,\ngovernments generally may not deprive citizens of liberty\nor property unless they do so according to \u201cthose settled us-\nages and modes of proceeding\u201d existing at common law.\nMurray\u2019s Lessee v.

And the Court points to no case\nblessing successive prosecutions by a single sovereign using\nits own and another\u2019s laws, much less any \u201csettled\u201d tradi-\ntion of doing so. So here again, the Court\u2019s decision today\nleaves much open for the future.\n                               *\n   As early as the 1890s, observers expressed concern that\nthe creation of the Court of Indian Offenses could make it\n\u201cpossible to try a man twice for the same offense,\u201d first for\na federal regulatory offense, then for a federal statutory\ncrime. Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Meeting of the\nLake Mohonk Conference 32 (1890) (statement of T. Riggs).\nAs they put it, a federal officer might \u201ctak[e] up\u201d a Native\nAmerican who might then \u201cspen[d] two or three days in the\nagency lockup\u201d pursuant to federal regulatory charges, and\n\u201cthen for the same offense [might] be brought before [a fed-\neral district] court.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87010\"><a href=\"/opinion/87010/murrays-lessee-v-hoboken-land-improvement-co/\">Ibid.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Today, that pessimistic predic-\ntion has proved true. It is hard to believe this Court would\nlong tolerate a similar state of affairs in any other context\u2014\nallowing federal bureaucrats to define an offense; prose-\ncute, judge, and punish an individual for it; and then trans-\nfer the case to the resident U. S. Attorney for a second trial\nfor the same offense under federal statutory law. Still, for\n\f14              DENEZPI v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nover a century that regime has persisted in this country for\nNative Americans, and today the Court extends its seal of\napproval to at least one aspect of it. Worse, the Court does\nso in the name of vindicating tribal sovereign authority.\nAnte, at 6. The irony will not be lost on those whose rights\nare diminished by today\u2019s decision.

Argued January 11, 2022\u2014Decided June 13, 2022*\nRespondents are aliens who were detained by the Federal Government\n  pursuant to 8 U. S. C. \u00a71231(a)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality\n  Act (INA). Respondents Esteban Aleman Gonzalez and Jose Eduardo\n  Gutierrez Sanchez\u2014the named plaintiffs in the case that bears Ale-\n  man Gonzalez\u2019s name\u2014are natives and citizens of Mexico who were\n  detained under \u00a71231(a)(6) after reentering the United States ille-\n  gally. They filed a putative class action in the United States District\n  Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that aliens de-\n  tained under \u00a71231(a)(6) are entitled to bond hearings after six\n  months\u2019 detention. The District Court certified a class of similarly sit-\n  uated plaintiffs and \u201cenjoined [the Government] from detaining [re-\n  spondents] and the class members pursuant to section 1231(a)(6) for\n  more than 180 days without providing each a bond hearing.\u201d Gonzalez\n  v. Sessions, 325 F. R. D. 616, 629. A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit\n  affirmed. Aleman Gonzalez v. Barr, 955 F. 3d 762, 766. Respondent\n  Edwin Flores Tejada\u2014the named plaintiff in the case that bears his\n  name\u2014is a native and citizen of El Salvador. He likewise reentered\n  the country illegally and was detained under \u00a71231(a)(6). He filed suit\n  in the Western District of Washington, alleging that \u00a71231(a)(6) enti-\n  tled him to a bond hearing. The District Court certified a class,\n  granted partial summary judgment against the Government, and en-\n  tered class-wide injunctive relief. A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit\n  affirmed. Flores Tejada v. Godfrey, 954 F. 3d 1245, 1247. This Court\n  granted certiorari and instructed the parties to brief the threshold\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with Garland, Attorney General, et al. v.

ALEMAN GONZALEZ\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    question whether the District Courts had jurisdiction to entertain re-\n    spondents\u2019 requests for class-wide injunctive relief under the INA.\nHeld: Section 1252(f )(1) of the INA deprived the District Courts of juris-\n diction to entertain respondents\u2019 requests for class-wide injunctive re-\n lief. Pp. 3\u201310.\n    (a) Section 1252(f )(1) generally strips lower courts of \u201cjurisdiction or\n authority\u201d to \u201cenjoin or restrain the operation of \u201d certain provisions of\n the INA. The ordinary meaning of the terms \u201cenjoin\u201d and \u201crestrain\u201d\n bars the class-wide relief awarded by the two District Courts here.\n When a court \u201cenjoins\u201d conduct, it issues an \u201cinjunction,\u201d which is a\n judicial order that \u201ctells someone what to do or not to do.\u201d Nken v.\n Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 428. The Court has suggested that \u201crestrain\u201d\n sometimes has a \u201cbroad meaning\u201d that refers to judicial orders that\n \u201cinhibit\u201d particular actions, and at other times it has a \u201cnarrower\n meaning\u201d that includes \u201corders that stop (or perhaps compel)\u201d such\n acts. Direct Marketing Assn. v. Brohl, 575 U. S. 1, 12\u201313. In\n \u00a71252(f )(1), the object of the verbs \u201cenjoin or restrain\u201d is the \u201coperation\n of \u201d certain provisions of the INA\u2014provisions that charge the Federal\n Government with the implementation and enforcement of the immi-\n gration laws governing the inspection, apprehension, examination,\n and removal of aliens. See \u00a7\u00a7 1221\u20131232. Putting these terms to-\n gether, \u00a71252(f )(1) generally prohibits lower courts from entering in-\n junctions that order federal officials to take or to refrain from taking\n actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the referenced\n INA statutory provisions.\n    Section 1252(f )(1) includes one exception to this general prohibition:\n The lower courts retain the authority to \u201cenjoin or restrain the opera-\n tion of \u201d the relevant statutory provisions \u201cwith respect to the applica-\n tion of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceed-\n ings under such part have been initiated.\u201d In Reno v. American-Arab\n Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 481\u2013482, the Court stated\n that \u00a71252(f )(1) \u201cprohibits federal courts from granting classwide in-\n junctive relief \u201d but \u201cdoes not extend to individual cases.\u201d Here, both\n District Courts entered injunctions requiring the Government to pro-\n vide bond hearings, not only for respondents, but also for all other class\n members.       Those orders \u201cenjoin or restrain the operation\u201d of\n \u00a71231(a)(6) because they require officials to take actions that (in the\n Government\u2019s view) are not required by \u00a71231(a)(6) and to refrain from\n actions that (again in the Government\u2019s view) are allowed by\n \u00a71231(a)(6). Those injunctions thus interfere with the Government\u2019s\n efforts to operate \u00a71231(a)(6), and the injunctions do not fall within the\n exception for individualized relief because the injunctions were en-\n tered on behalf of entire classes of aliens. Pp. 3\u20137.\n    (b) Respondents\u2019 two counter-arguments fail. First, respondents\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                       3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  contend that \u201cthe operation\u201d of the covered immigration provisions\n  means the operation of those provisions \u201cas properly interpreted\u201d and\n  that what \u00a71252(f )(1) bars are class-wide injunctions that prohibit the\n  Government from doing what the statute allows or commands. Brief\n  for Respondents 49 (emphasis added). The ordinary meaning of the\n  language of \u00a71252(f )(1) weighs against respondents\u2019 interpretation. It\n  is very common to refer to the \u201cunlawful\u201d or \u201cimproper\u201d operation of\n  something, and it is not apparent why the same cannot be said of a\n  statute. The statutory context provides additional reasons to reject\n  respondents\u2019 reading.\n     Respondents next argue that \u00a71252(f )(1) allows class-wide relief so\n  long as all the class members are \u201cindividuals who already face en-\n  forcement action.\u201d Brief for Respondents 55 (emphasis added). But\n  \u00a71252(f )(1) refers to \u201can individual,\u201d not \u201cindividuals,\u201d and the Court\n  has repeatedly stated that it bars class-wide injunctive relief. See, e.g.,\n  American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S., at 481. Re-\n  spondents argue that the absence of any express reference to class ac-\n  tions in \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2014unlike the express reference in \u00a71252(e)(1)\u2014sug-\n  gests that no preclusion of class-wide relief was intended The Court is\n  reluctant to give much weight to this negative inference; it is possible\n  that \u00a71252(f )(1) simply uses different language to bar class-wide in-\n  junctive relief. But a literal reading of the provision could also rule\n  out efforts to obtain any injunctive relief that applies to multiple\n  named plaintiffs. The Court has no occasion to adopt such an inter-\n  pretation here. It is sufficient to hold that the class-wide injunctive\n  relief awarded in these cases was unlawful.

Respond-\nents sued in two Federal District Courts, alleging that\n\u00a71231(a)(6) requires the Government to provide bond hear-\nings in cases like theirs. Both District Courts certified clas-\nses, agreed with respondents\u2019 claims on the merits, and en-\ntered class-wide injunctive relief. The Ninth Circuit\naffirmed both judgments in relevant part.\n  We granted certiorari and instructed the parties to ad-\ndress whether another provision of the Immigration and\nNationality Act, 66 Stat. 208, as amended, 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71252(f )(1), deprived the District Courts of jurisdiction to\nentertain respondents\u2019 requests for class-wide injunctive\nrelief.

See Johnson v. Arteaga-Martinez, 596\nU.

The ordinary mean-\ning of these terms bars the class-wide relief awarded by the\ntwo District Courts.\n   The term \u201cto enjoin\u201d ordinarily means to \u201crequire,\u201d \u201ccom-\nmand,\u201d or \u201cpositively direct\u201d an action or to \u201crequire a per-\nson to perform, . . . or to abstain or desist from, some act.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 529 (6th ed. 1990); see also Web-\nster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 754 (1993) (de-\nfining \u201cenjoin\u201d to mean \u201cto direct, prescribe, or impose by\norder\u201d).

The \u201coperation of \u201d (a thing) means the func-\ntioning of or working of (that thing). Random House Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 1357 (2d ed. 1987) (\u201can act\nor instance, process, or manner of functioning or operat-\ning\u201d); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, at\n1581 (\u201cmethod or manner of functioning\u201d). The way in\nwhich laws ordinarily \u201cwork\u201d or \u201cfunction\u201d is through the\nactions of officials or other persons who implement them.\nThis is certainly true of the statutes to which \u00a71252(f )(1)\nrefers\u2014i.e., the provisions of part IV of subchapter II of the\nImmigration and Nationality Act. Those provisions charge\nthe Federal Government with the implementation and en-\nforcement of the immigration laws governing the inspec-\ntion, apprehension, examination, and removal of aliens.\nSee \u00a7\u00a71221\u20131232. Accordingly, the \u201coperation of \u201d the rele-\nvant statutes is best understood to refer to the Govern-\nment\u2019s efforts to enforce or implement them. As the Gov-\nernment put it at oral argument, the \u201coperation of the\nprovisions\u201d is a reference \u201cnot just to the statute itself but\nto the way that [it is] being carried out.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg.\n11.\n   Putting these terms together, \u00a71252(f )(1) generally pro-\nhibits lower courts from entering injunctions that order fed-\neral officials to take or to refrain from taking actions to en-\nforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified\nstatutory provisions.\n                              2\n  Section 1252(f )(1) includes one exception to this general\nprohibition: The lower courts retain the authority to \u201cenjoin\nor restrain the operation of \u201d the relevant statutory provi-\nsions \u201cwith respect to the application of such provisions to\nan individual alien against whom proceedings under such\npart have been initiated.\u201d\n  The Court has already commented on the meaning of this\nexception. In Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination\n\f6                GARLAND v. ALEMAN GONZALEZ\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nComm., 525 U. S. 471, 481\u2013482 (1999), we wrote that\n\u00a71252(f )(1) \u201cprohibits federal courts from granting class-\nwide injunctive relief \u201d but \u201cdoes not extend to individual\ncases.\u201d See also Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___\n(2018) (slip op., at 29); Nken, 556 U. S., at 431.\n   This interpretation follows from the statutory text. In\nframing the exception to the general ban on injunctive re-\nlief, Congress used the phrase \u201can individual alien.\u201d It thus\nemployed a singular noun (\u201can alien\u201d), modified by an ad-\njective (\u201cindividual\u201d) that means \u201cpertaining or belonging\nto, or characteristic, of one single person.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dic-\ntionary, at 783. Therefore, \u00a71252(f )(1) does not preclude a\ncourt from entering injunctive relief on behalf of a particu-\nlar alien (so long as \u201cproceedings\u201d against the alien have\nbeen \u201cinitiated\u201d), but injunctive relief on behalf of an entire\nclass of aliens is not allowed because it is not limited to rem-\nedying the unlawful \u201capplication\u201d of the relevant statutes\nto \u201can individual alien.\u201d\n                              3\n  On this interpretation of \u00a71252(f )(1), the injunctions en-\ntered by the District Courts in these cases were barred. The\nrespondents in both cases were detained pursuant to\n\u00a71231(a)(6), and no one disputes that \u00a71231(a)(6) is among\nthe provisions the \u201coperation\u201d of which cannot be \u201cenjoined\nor restrained\u201d under \u00a71252(f )(1). Both District Courts en-\ntered injunctions requiring the Government to provide bond\nhearings not only for respondents but also for all other class\nmembers.1 Those orders \u201cenjoin or restrain the operation\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 See Gonzalez v.

Those in-\njunctions thus interfere with the Government\u2019s efforts to\noperate \u00a71231(a)(6), and the injunctions do not fall within\nthe exception for individualized relief because the injunc-\ntions were entered on behalf of entire classes of aliens.2\n                         B\n  Respondents advance two counter-arguments, but both\nfail.\n                               1\n   Respondents first contend that \u201cthe operation\u201d of the cov-\nered immigration provisions means the operation of those\nprovisions \u201cas properly interpreted\u201d and that what\n\u00a71252(f )(1) bars are class-wide injunctions that prohibit the\nGovernment from doing what the statute allows or com-\nmands. Brief for Respondents 49 (emphasis added).\n   We do not think that this is the most natural interpreta-\ntion of the term \u201coperation,\u201d since it is very common to refer\nto the \u201cunlawful\u201d or \u201cimproper\u201d operation of whatever it is\nthat is being operated. See, e.g., Brendlin v. California, 551\nU. S. 249, 253 (2007) (\u201cunlawful operation of the car\u201d); Kan-\nsas v. Colorado, 533 U.

Willard,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 At oral argument, the Government suggested that \u00a71252(f )(1) not\n\nonly bars class-wide injunctive relief but also prohibits any other form of\nrelief that is \u201cpractically similar to an injunction,\u201d including class-wide\ndeclaratory relief. Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. The Government analogized\n\u00a71252(f )(1) to the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71341, which we have\nheld extends to declaratory judgments. See California v. Grace Brethren\nChurch, 457 U. S. 393, 408\u2013409 (1982). Because only injunctive relief\nwas entered here, we have no occasion to address this argument.\n\f8                 GARLAND v. ALEMAN GONZALEZ\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n220 U. S. 413, 424 (1911) (\u201cunlawful operation of a rail-\nway\u201d); United States v.

If cars, trucks, rail-\nroads, water utilities, drainage ditches, auto dealerships,\nplanes, radios, video poker machines, cable TV systems,\nand many other things can be unlawfully or improperly op-\nerated, it is not apparent why the same cannot be said of a\nstatute. Thus, the ordinary meaning of the language of\n\u00a71252(f )(1) weighs against respondents\u2019 interpretation.3\n   Apart from ordinary meaning, the statutory context pro-\nvides three additional reasons to reject respondents\u2019 read-\ning. First, respondents\u2019 interpretation, which makes the\nreach of \u00a71252(f )(1) depend on the nature of the claim in\nquestion, clashes with \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s prefatory clause, which\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The dissent agrees that \u201coperation\u201d means \u201cfunctioning\u201d or \u201cworking,\u201d\n\nbut it claims that \u201cunlawful agency action is not a part of the functioning\nor working of the authorizing statute.\u201d Post, at 4 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,\nJ.). The reason that statutes cannot be operated unlawfully, according\nto the dissent, is this: \u201c[A] statute is the law. Officials may implement a\nstatute unlawfully, but a statute does not operate in conflict with itself.\u201d\nPost, at 11. But because to \u201cimplement\u201d a statute is to \u201ccarry out\u201d that\nstatute, Random House Dictionary of the English Language 715 (2d ed.\n1987); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1134 (1993), the\ndissent\u2019s concession that a statute can be \u201cimplement[ed]\u201d \u201cunlawfully\u201d\nis quite damaging to its position. The dissent asserts, but never explains\nwhy, the same cannot be said of a statute\u2019s \u201coperation.\u201d\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstates that the bar applies \u201c[r]egardless of the nature of the\naction or claim.\u201d See also Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U. S. ___,\n___ (2019) (slip op., at 4) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment).\n   Second, respondents\u2019 interpretation would limit\n\u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s restriction to a most unlikely set of claims.\nWith perhaps a few small exceptions,4 the only claims to\nwhich \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s prohibition would apply are constitu-\ntional claims. But it would be most unusual for Congress\nto disfavor constitutional claims in this way. Cf. Webster v.\nDoe, 486 U. S. 592, 603 (1988) (requiring \u201cclear\u201d indication\nof congressional intent to \u201cpreclude judicial review of con-\nstitutional claims\u201d). And if Congress had wanted to target\njust constitutional claims, it could have surely made the\npoint more directly. The suggestion that Congress sought\nto achieve that goal by using the term \u201coperation\u201d is far-\nfetched.\n   Third, respondents\u2019 interpretation would make a court\u2019s\njurisdiction to entertain a request for class-wide injunctive\nrelief dependent upon the merits of the claim. Under re-\nspondents\u2019 reading, if a complaint sought class-wide relief\non the ground that the Government was misinterpreting\nand misapplying a covered statutory provision, the court\nwould proceed to adjudicate the merits of that claim and\nmight even hold a trial. But if the court ultimately rejected\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Respondents argue in passing that their interpretation would also\n\nbar injunctive relief for certain statutory claims. See Brief for Respond-\nents 52; see also post, at 12\u201313. Respondents hypothesize a situation in\nwhich a non-immigration statute, or some immigration statute not spec-\nified in \u00a71252(f )(1), might require injunctive relief against the enforce-\nment of one of the covered immigration provisions. Their brief cited no\ncase in which such a situation has ever arisen. At oral argument counsel\nfor respondents did reference one case, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 34\u201335 (refer-\nencing Gonzales v. DHS, 508 F. 3d 1227 (CA9 2007)), but that case\nstands at most for the unresponsive proposition that a court may enjoin\nthe unlawful operation of a provision that is not specified in \u00a71252(f )(1)\neven if that injunction has some collateral effect on the operation of a\ncovered provision, see id., at 1233.\n\f10                GARLAND v. ALEMAN GONZALEZ\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthe claim on the merits, that holding would mean that the\ncourt never had jurisdiction to grant that request for relief.5\n  For all these reasons, respondents\u2019 interpretation of \u201cop-\neration\u201d must be rejected.\n                                 2\n  Respondents next argue that \u00a71252(f )(1) allows class-\nwide relief so long as all the class members are \u201cindividuals\nwho already face the enforcement action.\u201d Brief for Re-\nspondents 55 (emphasis added). But \u00a71252(f )(1) refers to\n\u201can individual,\u201d not \u201cindividuals,\u201d and as noted, we have\nstated on more than one occasion that it bars class-wide in-\njunctive relief. See American-Arab Anti-Discrimination\nComm., 525 U. S., at 481; Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 29); Nken, 556 U. S., at 431.\n  Respondents dispute the correctness of these statements\nand point out that a nearby provision, \u00a71252(e)(1)(B), ex-\npressly bars the certification of \u201ca class under Rule 23 of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Because \u00a71252(f )(1)\nlacks any express reference to class actions, respondents in-\nfer that no preclusion of class-wide relief was intended.\n  We are reluctant to give much weight to this negative in-\nference. It is possible that \u00a71252(f )(1) simply uses different\nlanguage to bar class-wide injunctive relief and extends no\nfurther. But if the provision is not read that way, then the\nmost plausible reading is not that it allows class-wide relief\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The dissent says, post, at 13, that it is common for jurisdictional in-\n\nquiries and the merits to overlap, and that is of course true. But the\ndissent\u2019s interpretation would mean that \u00a71252(f )(1) precludes injunc-\ntive relief for a plaintiff \u2019s statutory claim if, but only if, that claim al-\nready independently fails on the merits. The dissent cannot seriously\ndispute that such complete overlap between a jurisdictional inquiry and\nthe merits of a claim is unusual, and an interpretation of \u00a71252(f )(1) that\nbars injunctive relief only when such relief would already be improper\nfails to \u201cgive effect\u201d to \u201cevery clause\u201d of \u00a71252(f )(1).

A lit-\neral reading of that language could rule out efforts to obtain\nany injunctive relief that applies to multiple named plain-\ntiffs (or perhaps even rule out injunctive relief in a lawsuit\nbrought by multiple named plaintiffs).\n   The Government does not advocate that we adopt such an\ninterpretation, see Reply Brief 11, and we have no occasion\nto do so in these cases. It is sufficient to hold that the class-\nwide injunctive relief awarded in these cases was unlawful.6\n                      *     *    *\n  The judgments of the Court of Appeals are reversed, and\nthe cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    6 The dissent also notes that Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 698\u2013\n\n701 (1979), held that the Social Security Act provisions permitting\n\u201c \u2018[a]ny individual\u2019 \u201d to file a \u201ccivil action\u201d did not preclude class-wide re-\nlief. See post, at 7\u20138, 14. That judicial-review provision, the Court rea-\nsoned, was not \u201cexempt\u201d from the \u201coperation of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure\u201d that authorized class actions. Califano, 442 U. S., at 700.\nSection 1252(f )(1) is quite different: It does not authorize judicial review\nbut limits it, and the saving clause is an exception to the general bar on\ninjunctive relief that must be read \u201cnarrowly in order to preserve the\nprimary operation of the provision.\u201d Maracich v. Spears, 570 U. S. 48,\n60 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Califano is thus inappo-\nsite.\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

The\nNinth Circuit affirmed in relevant part.\n   When the Government petitioned for certiorari, it chal-\nlenged only the lower courts\u2019 interpretations of \u00a71231(a)(6)\nas requiring bond hearings after six months of detention.\nSee Pet. for Cert. I. The Court granted certiorari on the\nquestion presented by the Government in these cases and a\ncompanion case from the Third Circuit. 594 U. S. ___\n(2021); see Johnson v. Arteaga-Martinez, 596 U. S. ___\n(2022). The Court additionally directed the parties in these\ncases \u201cto brief and argue the following question: Whether,\nunder 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252(f )(1), the courts below had jurisdic-\ntion to grant classwide injunctive relief.\u201d 594 U. S. ___. As\nto that question, the Court now holds that \u00a71252(f )(1)\nbarred the lower courts from granting such relief.\n                               II\n  Section 1252(f )(1) sets forth a precise limitation on the\nlower federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction to enter injunctive relief in\ncases involving specified sections of the INA. The provision\nstates:\n    \u201c(f ) Limit on injunctive relief\n       \u201c(1) In general\n       \u201cRegardless of the nature of the action or claim or of\n    the identity of the party or parties bringing the action,\n    no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have ju-\n    risdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the opera-\n    tion of [\u00a7\u00a71221\u20131232], as amended by the Illegal Immi-\n    gration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n    1996, other than with respect to the application of such\n    provisions to an individual alien against whom pro-\n    ceedings under such part have been initiated.\u201d\n  Section 1252(f )(1) includes two operative clauses: a pri-\nmary clause that strips courts of authority \u201cto enjoin or re-\nstrain the operation of \u201d the specified provisions of the INA,\n\f4             GARLAND v. ALEMAN GONZALEZ\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nand a saving clause that reserves that authority as applied\nto a noncitizen \u201cagainst whom proceedings . . . have been\ninitiated.\u201d Properly read, both clauses independently pre-\nserve the lower courts\u2019 authority to order classwide injunc-\ntive relief compelling the Executive Branch to comply with\nthe INA in these cases. The Court holds otherwise only by\ndisregarding the language Congress used in \u00a71252(f )(1) it-\nself, elsewhere in \u00a71252, and in the INA as a whole.\n                               A\n                               1\n   Section 1252(f )(1)\u2019s primary clause provides that the\nlower federal courts may not \u201cenjoin or restrain the opera-\ntion of \u201d the specified provisions of the INA. An injunction\nthat compels the Executive Branch to comply with the spec-\nified provisions (or, phrased differently, prohibits the un-\nlawful implementation of the specified provisions) does not\n\u201cenjoin or restrain\u201d the \u201coperation\u201d of those provisions.\n   This is clear as a matter of plain meaning. Starting with\nthe word \u201coperation,\u201d all agree that the ordinary meaning\nof \u201coperation\u201d is \u201cfunctioning\u201d or \u201cworking.\u201d Ante, at 5. An\ninjunction requiring the Executive Branch to conform its\nconduct with a statute or to cease statutorily unauthorized\nconduct does not enjoin or restrain the \u201cfunctioning or\nworking\u201d of the statute. That is because unlawful agency\naction is not a part of the functioning or working of the au-\nthorizing statute.\n   The Government responds that \u201coperation,\u201d as used in\n\u00a71252(f )(1), is synonymous with \u201cimplementation,\u201d which\nmay include either lawful or unlawful implementation.\nThis contention, however, disregards Congress\u2019 careful\nchoice of language. Section 1252(f )(1) says nothing about\nenjoining or restraining the Executive Branch\u2019s \u201cimplemen-\ntation\u201d of the law. By contrast, in other subsections of\n\u00a71252 enacted simultaneously with this one, Congress\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

See\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(A)(i) (restricting jurisdiction to review claims\n\u201carising from or relating to the implementation or operation\nof an order of removal\u201d); \u00a71252(e)(3)(A) (channeling review\nof the \u201cimplementation\u201d of specified provisions into the\nU.

As this Court previously ex-\nplained when interpreting this very statute: \u201c \u2018[W]here\nCongress includes particular language in one section of a\nstatute but omits it in another section . . . it is generally\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely\nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019 \u201d Nken v. Holder,\n556 U. S. 418, 430 (2009). \u201cThis is particularly true here,\nwhere [the relevant subsections of \u00a71252] were enacted as\npart of a unified overhaul of judicial review procedures.\u201d\nId., at 430\u2013431.\n   In addition to Congress\u2019 deliberate use of \u201coperation,\u201d its\nuse of \u201cenjoin or restrain\u201d in this context is most naturally\nread to bar only lower court injunctions that stop the oper-\nation of a statute, not those that command the Executive\nBranch to conform its conduct to the statute. It is true that,\ndepending on the context, the word \u201cenjoin\u201d may describe a\nprohibition (\u201cabstain or desist from . . . some act\u201d) or an af-\nfirmative command (\u201cperform . . . some act\u201d). Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 529 (6th ed. 1990); see ante, at 4. In \u00a71252(f )(1),\nhowever, clear textual signals point to the conclusion that\n\u201cenjoin\u201d refers to a prohibition on the operation of a statute.\nFirst, Congress consistently has used the term \u201cenjoin\u201d in\nTitle 8 to refer to prohibitions, including in the immediately\nneighboring and simultaneously enacted subsection,\n\f6                 GARLAND v. ALEMAN GONZALEZ\n\n                         Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n\u00a71252(f )(2).3 \u201cA standard principle of statutory construc-\ntion provides that identical words and phrases within the\nsame statute should normally be given the same meaning,\u201d\nPowerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U. S.\n224, 232 (2007), particularly where, as here, \u201cthe same term\nwas used in related provisions enacted at the same time,\u201d\nReturn Mail, Inc. v. Postal Service, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019)\n(slip op., at 12). Even beyond \u00a71252 itself, every use of \u201cen-\njoin\u201d in Title 8 refers to prohibitory injunctions.4 Moreover,\nin \u00a71252(f )(1) specifically, \u201cenjoin\u201d is paired with the term\n\u201crestrain,\u201d which means to \u201ccheck, hold back, or prevent (a\nperson or thing) from some course of action.\u201d 8 Oxford Eng-\nlish Dictionary 756 (2d ed. 1989) (emphasis deleted). \u201c[T]he\ncompany [the word] keeps,\u201d Direct Marketing Assn. v.\nBrohl, 575 U. S. 1, 13 (2015), thus cements a prohibitory\nreading of \u201cenjoin.\u201d Under this reading, lower courts may\nnot prohibit the operation of the specified statutes, but\nnothing in \u00a71252(f )(1) prevents them from commanding\ncompliance with the statutes or enjoining unauthorized\nagency action.\n   Finally, if any ambiguity remains as to the meaning of\nthe primary \u201cenjoin or restrain the operation of \u201d clause, a\nlongstanding clear-statement principle counsels in favor of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Section 1252(f )(2) provides: \u201c[N]o court shall enjoin the removal of\n\nany alien pursuant to a final order under this section unless the alien\nshows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of\nsuch order is prohibited as a matter of law.\u201d This use of \u201cenjoin\u201d can only\nmean \u201cprohibit.\u201d\n  4 See \u00a71227(a)(2)(E)(ii) (enacted simultaneously with \u00a71252 and refer-\n\nring to a noncitizen \u201cwho at any time after admission is enjoined under\na protection order issued by a court,\u201d with \u201cprotection order\u201d defined as\n\u201cany injunction issued for the purpose of preventing violent or threaten-\ning acts of domestic violence\u201d); \u00a71324a(f )(2) (authorizing the Attorney\nGeneral to sue over pattern or practice of unlawful employment, recruit-\nment, or referral of noncitizens under header titled \u201c[e]njoining of pat-\ntern or practice violations\u201d). After oral argument in these cases, Con-\ngress used the term \u201cenjoined\u201d in an amendment to an additional\nprovision of Title 8, again in a prohibitory sense.

This Court \u201c \u2018will not construe a statute to displace\ncourts\u2019 traditional equitable authority absent the clearest\ncommand.\u2019 \u201d McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U. S. 383, 397\n(2013) (quoting Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631, 646\n(2010)); accord, e.g., Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U. S.\n395, 398 (1946); Brown v. Swann, 10 Pet. 497, 503 (1836).\nThere can be no doubt that \u00a71252(f )(1) operates to displace\nequitable authority to an extent. As explained, however,\nthe most natural and contextual reading of the provision\u2019s\nprimary clause does not limit federal courts\u2019 authority to\nenjoin or restrain agency action unauthorized by statute, or\nto compel agency action commanded by a statute. The\nclause contains nothing approaching the clear command\nnecessary, under centuries of this Court\u2019s precedents, to\ndisplace that authority.\n                              2\n   Independently of \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s primary clause, the provi-\nsion\u2019s saving clause also operates to preserve the lower fed-\neral courts\u2019 equitable authority here. That clause provides\nthat lower courts may enjoin or restrain the operation of the\ncovered statutory provisions \u201cwith respect to the applica-\ntion of such provisions to an individual alien against whom\nproceedings under such part have been initiated.\u201d\n\u00a71252(f )(1). Each beneficiary of the injunctions in these\ncases is \u201can individual alien against whom [removal] pro-\nceedings . . . have been initiated.\u201d Ibid. Under these cir-\ncumstances, \u00a71252(f )(1) poses no barrier to classwide in-\njunctive relief.\n   The Government contends that the phrase \u201can individual\nalien\u201d is inconsistent with injunctive relief on a classwide\nbasis. A class action, however, is a collection of individual\nclaims. See, e.g., Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 701\n(1979) (\u201cWhere the district court has jurisdiction over the\n\f8              GARLAND v.

A. v.\nAllstate Ins. Co., 559 U. S. 393, 408 (2010) (plurality opinion\nof Scalia, J.) (\u201cA class action, no less than traditional joinder\n(of which it is a species), merely enables a federal court to\nadjudicate claims of multiple parties at once, instead of in\nseparate suits\u201d). Moreover, contextual and historical evi-\ndence demonstrates that the enacting Congress would not\nhave prohibited classwide relief simply by using the word\n\u201cindividual.\u201d\n   It was well understood when Congress enacted\n\u00a71252(f )(1) in 1996 that mere use of the word \u201cindividual\u201d\nwould not preclude classwide adjudication or relief. In Cali-\nfano, a unanimous Court interpreted \u00a7205(g) of the Social\nSecurity Act, codified at 42 U. S. C. \u00a7405(g), to permit class\nactions and classwide relief, even though the statute pro-\nvided only that \u201c \u2018[a]ny individual\u2019 \u201d could obtain judicial re-\nview. See 442 U. S., at 698\u2013701. The Court rejected the\nGovernment\u2019s argument that the word \u201cindividual\u201d re-\nquired \u201ca case-by-case adjudication of claims under \u00a7205(g)\nthat is incompatible with class relief.\u201d Id., at 698\u2013699.\n\u201c[C]lass relief is consistent with the need for case-by-case\nadjudication,\u201d the Court noted, \u201cat least so long as the mem-\nbership of the class is limited to those who meet the require-\nments of \u201d the provision. Id., at 701.\n   \u201cWe normally assume that, when Congress enacts stat-\nutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent.\u201d Merck &\nCo. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. 633, 648 (2010).                When\n\u00a71252(f )(1) was enacted in 1996, that precedent included\nboth Califano and the settled rule, discussed above, that a\nstatute should not be construed to displace a court\u2019s equita-\nble authority absent a clear command. Yet Congress pro-\nvided no such command against all classwide injunctive re-\nlief in \u00a71252(f )(1).\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            9\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n   Indeed, in other subsections of \u00a71252, Congress provided\nprecisely such a clear command. Section 1252(e)(1)(B), en-\nacted simultaneously with \u00a71252(f )(1), explicitly divests\nfederal courts of authority to \u201ccertify a class under Rule 23\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\u201d in certain cases.\nThe enacting Congress thus knew how to preclude class-\nwide relief and did so in unmistakable terms when that was\nits intent. In \u00a71252(f )(1), however, it made no mention of\nclass actions or Rule 23. Again, \u201c \u2018it is generally presumed\nthat Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the dis-\nparate inclusion or exclusion\u2019 \u201d of language, particularly\nwhere, as here, it enacted the language as part of a unified\nwhole. Nken, 556 U. S., at 430.\n   The Government responds that this reading of\n\u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s saving clause renders the word \u201cindividual\u201d\nsuperfluous. \u201c \u2018[S]ometimes the better overall reading of the\nstatute contains some redundancy,\u2019 \u201d however, as Congress\nmay \u201cemplo[y] a belt and suspenders approach\u201d to ensure\nits aims are met. Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Christian, 590\nU. S. ___, ___, n. 5 (2020) (slip op., at 10, n. 5). Relevant\nhere, parties other than individuals in removal proceedings\nmay bring immigration-related lawsuits. For example,\nprior to 1996, several organizations brought preenforce-\nment challenges to immigration statutes. See Brief for Re-\nspondents 55 (collecting examples). In recent years, States,\ntoo, increasingly have sued on behalf of their own interests.\nSee, e.g., Biden v. Texas, No. 21\u2013954, now pending before\nthe Court; Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of\nUniv. of Cal., 591 U. S. ___ (2020); United States v. Texas,\n579 U. S. 547 (2016) (per curiam). In drafting \u00a71252(f )(1),\nCongress had every reason \u201cto be doubly sure,\u201d Barton v.\nBarr, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 16), that only\nindividuals in removal proceedings and not other entities\nwould receive injunctive relief restraining the operation of\nthe specified provisions of the INA. Additionally, the Gov-\nernment\u2019s redundancy concern is particularly unpersuasive\n\f10             GARLAND v. ALEMAN GONZALEZ\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nbecause Congress used the adjective \u201cindividual\u201d redun-\ndantly in other immigration-related provisions within Title\n8. See \u00a71446(a) (authorizing the Attorney General to waive\ninvestigation of applicant for naturalization \u201cin an individ-\nual case or in such cases or classes of cases as may be des-\nignated by him\u201d); \u00a71601(4) (expressing concern that \u201cindi-\nvidual aliens,\u201d prior to 1996, were \u201cburden[ing] the public\nbenefits system\u201d).\n                               3\n   In sum, the courts below retained their equitable author-\nity to issue classwide injunctive relief for two independent\nreasons. First, the relief the District Courts issued did not\npurport \u201cto enjoin or restrain the operation of \u201d any statute;\nrather, the District Courts sought to enforce a statute and\nenjoin what they deemed to be unlawful agency action. Sec-\nond, and in any event, the injunctive relief issued below fell\nwithin \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s saving clause because it concerned only\nthe application of provisions of the INA to individual noncit-\nizens in removal proceedings.\n   This interpretation is a reasonable one. Congress\u2019 ex-\npress and particular use of words in \u00a71252(f )(1) protected\nthe specified statutory provisions against restraint by lower\ncourt injunctions, but evinced no quarrel with lower courts\nensuring that the Executive Branch complied with the com-\nmands in those provisions. In addition, Congress ensured\nthat this goal did not come at the expense of violating the\nrights of noncitizens in removal proceedings.\n                            B\n  The Court reaches a contrary result only by prioritizing\nunavailing and largely atextual concerns.\n                              1\n   Starting with the primary \u201cenjoin or restrain the opera-\ntion of \u201d clause, the Court accepts the Government\u2019s argu-\nment that \u201cthe \u2018operation of \u2019 the relevant statutes is best\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

Aside from ignoring Con-\ngress\u2019 choice to restrict judicial review of \u201cimplementation\u201d\nin some subsections of \u00a71252 but not others, the Court mis-\napprehends how statutes operate. No doubt, \u201claws ordinar-\nily \u2018work\u2019 or \u2018function\u2019 . . . through the actions of officials or\nother persons who implement them.\u201d Ante, at 5. That prop-\nosition, however, only holds if those individuals properly\nimplement the relevant statute. An unlawful implementa-\ntion of a statute is not the \u201cwork[ing]\u201d or \u201cfunction[ing]\u201d of\nthe statute at all; it is simply unauthorized. Restraining\nsuch action does not interfere with the operation of the stat-\nute for purposes of \u00a71252(f )(1).\n   Resisting this result, the Court offers a string cite of sev-\neral inapt uses of \u201coperation,\u201d none of which concern the op-\neration of legal authority. See ante, at 7\u20138. The Court won-\nders why, \u201c[i]f cars, trucks, railroads, water utilities,\ndrainage ditches, auto dealerships, planes, radios, video\npoker machines, cable TV systems, and many other things\ncan be unlawfully or improperly operated, . . . the same can-\nnot be said of a statute.\u201d Ante, at 8. The answer is obvious:\nUnlike all of those examples, a statute is the law. Officials\nmay implement a statute unlawfully, but a statute does not\noperate in conflict with itself.5\n   The Court also agrees with the Government that \u201cenjoin,\u201d\nas used in \u00a71252(f )(1), necessarily takes on both affirmative\nand negative connotations, but only by rigidly segmenting\neach word in the clause, defining each in isolation, and add-\ning those definitions together. See ante, at 4. Elsewhere,\nhowever, this Court has cautioned against such a piecemeal\napproach to statutory interpretation. Cf., e.g., FCC v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The Court\u2019s sole response is to suggest that if an official can \u201c \u2018carry\n\nout\u2019 \u201d a statute contrary to its terms, the statute should be able to \u201c \u2018op-\nerat[e]\u2019 \u201d contrary to itself, too. Ante, at 8, n. 3. This once again elides\nthe distinction Congress drew in \u00a71252 between \u201cimplementation\u201d and\n\u201coperation,\u201d a difference that must be given meaning.

S. 397, 406 (2011) (cautioning that \u201ctwo\nwords together may assume a more particular meaning\nthan those words in isolation\u201d). Moreover, the Court pays\nno mind to Congress\u2019 other uses of \u201cenjoin\u201d in \u00a71252 and\nelsewhere in Title 8 as meaning banning or stopping.\n   The Court offers one final purportedly textual basis for\nits strained reading of the primary clause: that it is the only\noption consistent with \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s prefatory clause. See\nante, at 8\u20139; \u00a71252(f )(1) (\u201cRegardless of the nature of the\naction or claim . . . \u201d). The prefatory clause, however, does\nnot purport to expand the scope of \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s restriction;\nit simply makes clear that the restriction must apply to all\nclaims that would otherwise fall within it, without excep-\ntion. See Atlantic Richfield Co., 590 U. S., at ___, n. 5 (slip\nop., at 10, n. 5) (reasoning similarly as to phrase \u201c \u2018without\nregard to the citizenship of the parties or the amount in con-\ntroversy\u2019 \u201d).\n   The Court closes with two policy arguments. It deems it\n\u201cmost unlikely\u201d that Congress would enact a statute that\ndisproportionately limits lower courts\u2019 authority to issue in-\njunctive relief to remedy constitutional claims, a result it\ncontends would flow from respondents\u2019 reading. Ante, at 9.\nThis is in large part a problem of the Court\u2019s own making.\nAs explained, a proper interpretation of \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s saving\nclause preserves lower courts\u2019 authority to issue injunctive\nrelief on constitutional claims, including on a classwide ba-\nsis, so long as all plaintiffs are individuals against whom\nremoval proceedings have been initiated. Moreover, even\nin preenforcement challenges brought by entities or by in-\ndividuals not in removal proceedings, respondents\u2019 reading\nof \u00a71252(f )(1) does not prohibit injunctive relief exclusively\nas to constitutional claims, but also as to claims that arise\nfrom any statutes external to the covered INA provisions\n(for example, a claim that a covered provision violates the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)). See ante, at 9,\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                       13\n\n                         Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nn. 4. The correct reading of \u00a71252(f )(1) evenhandedly pro-\ntects the specified INA provisions from all such external,\npreenforcement, lower court injunctions, whether on statu-\ntory or constitutional grounds, without shielding unlawful\nagency action inconsistent with the specified provisions.\nWhatever the Court may think of the wisdom of that policy,\nit is a perfectly plausible one.\n   The Court also worries that under this reading of\n\u00a71252(f )(1), the inquiry as to whether injunctive relief is\navailable may overlap with the merits of a claim that a cov-\nered provision has been violated. Ante, at 9\u201310. The Court\nis wrong to find \u201canything unusual about that conse-\nquence.\u201d Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. 338, 351\n(2011). Even as to the question of subject-matter jurisdic-\ntion (as opposed to the remedial authority at issue here),\n\u201c[t]he necessity of touching aspects of the merits . . . is a fa-\nmiliar feature of litigation.\u201d Id., at 351\u2013352; accord, e.g.,\nPerry v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., 582 U. S. ___, ___\n(2017) (slip op., at 14) (\u201c[T]he distinction between jurisdic-\ntional and merits issues is not inevitably sharp, for the two\ninquiries may overlap\u201d). Any overlap may be substantial:\nUnder the Federal Tort Claims Act, for instance, \u201call ele-\nments of a meritorious claim are also jurisdictional.\u201d\nBrownback v. King, 592 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 8).6\nThis concern, too, offers no justification for the Court\u2019s de-\nparture from ordinary meaning or its disregard of clear con-\ntextual evidence contrary to its view.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Court states that respondents\u2019 reading of \u00a71252(f)(1) will, in some\n\ncases, cause a \u201ccomplete overlap between a jurisdictional inquiry and the\nmerits of a claim.\u201d Ante, at 10, n. 5. Once again, such an overlap is far\nfrom unprecedented. Moreover, as the Court implicitly concedes, it will\nnot always be present. As explained, respondents\u2019 interpretation divests\nthe lower courts of authority to issue injunctive relief on external chal-\nlenges to the specified provisions (e.g., a challenge to a specified provision\nbased on RFRA or the Due Process Clause), regardless of the merits of\nthose challenges, unless the saving clause applies.\n\f14             GARLAND v. ALEMAN GONZALEZ\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n                                2\n   The Court\u2019s arguments in support of its reading of the\nsaving clause fare little better. The Court opens with lan-\nguage from past cases suggesting support for its interpre-\ntation. See ante, at 5\u20136. None of the cases the Court quotes,\nhowever, presented or decided the scope of \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s bar\non injunctive relief.\n   The Court next affords dispositive weight to its class-\nexclusive view of the word \u201cindividual\u201d in \u00a71252(f )(1). See\nante, at 6. The Court distinguishes Califano in a footnote,\nasserting that \u00a71252(f)(1)\u2019s saving clause should be con-\nstrued narrowly because it is an exception to the primary\nclause. See ante, at 11, n. 6. The point, however, is not that\nthe statute interpreted in Califano was identical to\n\u00a71252(f)(1), but that Califano established that a statute\u2019s\nmere use of the word \u201cindividual\u201d does not suffice to pre-\nclude classwide relief. Moreover, the Court overlooks that\nit is \u00a71252(f)(1)\u2019s primary clause (which divests lower courts\nof their \u201c \u2018traditional equitable authority\u2019 \u201d) that constitutes\nan exception to the norm. McQuiggin, 569 U. S., at 397.\nThe Court ignores the clear-statement rule for such dis-\nplacements of courts\u2019 equitable jurisdiction. Califano and\nthe clear-statement rule both instruct that Congress would\nnot have done so much so obliquely, particularly when it\nclearly prohibited class relief in another subsection of the\nsame statute.\n   On the question of Congress\u2019 disparate inclusion and ex-\nclusion of language in \u00a71252 referring to class actions, the\nCourt declines to decide what it thinks. Taking one path, it\nsuggests that one should not \u201cgive much weight to this neg-\native inference.\u201d Ante, at 10. But see Nken, 556 U. S., at\n430\u2013431 (giving weight to equivalent inference when inter-\npreting same statute). Taking another, the Court admits\nthat adhering to its holding might well \u201crule out efforts to\nobtain any injunctive relief that applies to multiple named\nplaintiffs (or perhaps even rule out injunctive relief in a\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

There is no con-\nceivable benefit in requiring identical claims to be raised in\nseparate, duplicative actions. This bizarre outcome offers\nfurther proof that the Court has erred.\n                              III\n   The ramifications of the Court\u2019s errors should not be ig-\nnored. Today\u2019s holding risks depriving many vulnerable\nnoncitizens of any meaningful opportunity to protect their\nrights.\n   To understand why, consider the practical realities of the\nremoval and detention system. Noncitizens subjected to re-\nmoval proceedings are disproportionately unlikely to be fa-\nmiliar with the U. S. legal system or fluent in the English\nlanguage. Even so, these individuals must navigate the Na-\ntion\u2019s labyrinthine immigration laws without entitlement\nto appointed counsel or legal support. If they are detained,\nlike respondents here, they face particularly daunting hur-\ndles. On average, immigration detention facilities are lo-\ncated significantly farther away from detained individuals\u2019\ncommunities and court proceedings than criminal jails,\nmaking it extraordinarily difficult to secure legal represen-\ntation. Even for those individuals who can locate and afford\ncounsel under these circumstances, such remote confine-\nment impedes evidence gathering and communication with\ncounsel. After traveling (perhaps for hours) to meet with\ndetained clients, attorneys may be barred from doing so due\nto logistical or administrative errors; legal phone calls, too,\nfrequently are nonconfidential, prohibitively costly, or oth-\nerwise unavailable. Exacerbating these challenges, the\n\f16               GARLAND v. ALEMAN GONZALEZ\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nGovernment regularly transfers detained noncitizens be-\ntween facilities, often multiple times.7\n   It is one matter to expect noncitizens facing these obsta-\ncles to defend against their removal in immigration court.\nIt is another entirely to place upon each of them the added\nburden of contesting systemic violations of their rights\nthrough discrete, collateral, federal-court proceedings. In a\ngreat many cases, the inevitable consequence of barring\nclasswide injunctive relief will be that those violations will\ngo unremedied, except as to the few fortunate enough to af-\nford competent collateral counsel or to secure vigorous\npro bono representation. The burdens will fall on those\nleast able to vindicate their rights, as well as the law firms\nand nonprofit organizations that will endeavor to assist as\nmany of these noncitizens as their capacity permits.8\n   If, somehow, a substantial number of noncitizens are able\nto overcome these obstacles and file separate federal law-\nsuits against unlawful removal or detention policies, a dif-\nferent problem will arise.

In contrast, the Court\u2019s overbroad\nreading of \u00a71252(f )(1) forces noncitizens facing unlawful de-\ntention, if they are able, \u201cto flood district court dockets with\nindividual habeas actions raising materially indistinguish-\nable claims and requesting materially indistinguishable in-\njunctive relief.\u201d Brief for Retired Federal Judges as Amici\nCuriae 15. There is no reason to think Congress intended\neither of these untenable results.\n   In fairness, the Court\u2019s decision is not without limits. For\ninstance, the Court does not purport to hold that\n\u00a71252(f )(1) affects courts\u2019 ability to \u201chold unlawful and set\naside agency action, findings, and conclusions\u201d under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2). No such\nclaim is raised here. In addition, the Court rightly does not\nembrace the Government\u2019s eleventh-hour suggestion at oral\nargument to hold that \u00a71252(f )(1) bars even classwide de-\nclaratory relief,9 a suggestion that would (if accepted) leave\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Although I reach no definitive conclusion on this unpresented issue,\n\nit is difficult to square the Government\u2019s claim with the statute Congress\nenacted. Section 1252(f )(1) limits lower courts\u2019 authority to \u201cenjoin or\nrestrain,\u201d whereas a declaratory judgment (unlike an injunction) \u201c \u2018is not\nultimately coercive.\u2019 \u201d Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S. 452, 471 (1974). In\naddition, \u00a71252(f )(1) is titled \u201c[l]imit on injunctive relief,\u201d in contrast to\nnearby \u00a71252(e)(1)\u2019s broader \u201c[l]imitations on relief.\u201d True to its title,\n\u00a71252(e)(1) expressly prohibits courts from \u201center[ing] declaratory, in-\njunctive, or other equitable relief \u201d under certain circumstances, whereas\n\u00a71252(f )(1) makes no mention of declaratory relief.\n   Moreover, if (as the Court holds today) \u00a71252(f )(1) bars classwide re-\nlief, and (as the Government suggests) the provision affects both injunc-\ntive and declaratory relief, it is hard to see how any class action could\nproceed, as no relief would be available in the lower courts. That, in turn,\nwould prevent any such case from reaching this Court, rendering Con-\ngress\u2019 reservation of this Court\u2019s authority a nullity. See \u00a71252(f )(1)\n(stripping authority from all courts \u201cother than the Supreme Court\u201d).\n\f18               GARLAND v.

Brief\n  for Respondents 49 (emphasis added). The ordinary meaning of the\n  language of \u00a71252(f )(1) weighs against respondents\u2019 interpretation. It\n  is very common to refer to the \u201cunlawful\u201d or \u201cimproper\u201d operation of\n  something, and it is not apparent why the same cannot be said of a\n  statute. The statutory context provides additional reasons to reject\n  respondents\u2019 reading.\n     Respondents next argue that \u00a71252(f )(1) allows class-wide relief so\n  long as all the class members are \u201cindividuals who already face en-\n  forcement action.\u201d Brief for Respondents 55 (emphasis added). But\n  \u00a71252(f )(1) refers to \u201can individual,\u201d not \u201cindividuals,\u201d and the Court\n  has repeatedly stated that it bars class-wide injunctive relief. See, e.g.,\n  American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118264\"><a href=\"/opinion/118264/reno-v-american-arab-anti-discrimination-comm/\">525 U. S., at 481</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Re-\n  spondents argue that the absence of any express reference to class ac-\n  tions in \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2014unlike the express reference in \u00a71252(e)(1)\u2014sug-\n  gests that no preclusion of class-wide relief was intended The Court is\n  reluctant to give much weight to this negative inference; it is possible\n  that \u00a71252(f )(1) simply uses different language to bar class-wide in-\n  junctive relief. But a literal reading of the provision could also rule\n  out efforts to obtain any injunctive relief that applies to multiple\n  named plaintiffs. The Court has no occasion to adopt such an inter-\n  pretation here. It is sufficient to hold that the class-wide injunctive\n  relief awarded in these cases was unlawful.

While they\nawaited proceedings before an immigration judge, they\nwere detained under \u00a71231(a)(6), and they then filed a pu-\ntative class action in the United States District Court for\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that aliens de-\ntained under \u00a71231(a)(6) are entitled to bond hearings after\nsix months\u2019 detention. The District Court certified a class\nof similarly situated plaintiffs and \u201cenjoined [the Govern-\nment] from detaining [respondents] and the class members\npursuant to section 1231(a)(6) for more than 180 days with-\nout providing each a bond hearing.\u201d Gonzalez v.

The \u201coperation of \u201d (a thing) means the func-\ntioning of or working of (that thing). Random House Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 1357 (2d ed. 1987) (\u201can act\nor instance, process, or manner of functioning or operat-\ning\u201d); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, at\n1581 (\u201cmethod or manner of functioning\u201d). The way in\nwhich laws ordinarily \u201cwork\u201d or \u201cfunction\u201d is through the\nactions of officials or other persons who implement them.\nThis is certainly true of the statutes to which \u00a71252(f )(1)\nrefers\u2014i.e., the provisions of part IV of subchapter II of the\nImmigration and Nationality Act. Those provisions charge\nthe Federal Government with the implementation and en-\nforcement of the immigration laws governing the inspec-\ntion, apprehension, examination, and removal of aliens.\nSee \u00a7\u00a71221\u20131232. Accordingly, the \u201coperation of \u201d the rele-\nvant statutes is best understood to refer to the Govern-\nment\u2019s efforts to enforce or implement them. As the Gov-\nernment put it at oral argument, the \u201coperation of the\nprovisions\u201d is a reference \u201cnot just to the statute itself but\nto the way that [it is] being carried out.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg.\n11.\n   Putting these terms together, \u00a71252(f )(1) generally pro-\nhibits lower courts from entering injunctions that order fed-\neral officials to take or to refrain from taking actions to en-\nforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified\nstatutory provisions.\n                              2\n  Section 1252(f )(1) includes one exception to this general\nprohibition: The lower courts retain the authority to \u201cenjoin\nor restrain the operation of \u201d the relevant statutory provi-\nsions \u201cwith respect to the application of such provisions to\nan individual alien against whom proceedings under such\npart have been initiated.\u201d\n  The Court has already commented on the meaning of this\nexception.

In\nframing the exception to the general ban on injunctive re-\nlief, Congress used the phrase \u201can individual alien.\u201d It thus\nemployed a singular noun (\u201can alien\u201d), modified by an ad-\njective (\u201cindividual\u201d) that means \u201cpertaining or belonging\nto, or characteristic, of one single person.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dic-\ntionary, at 783. Therefore, \u00a71252(f )(1) does not preclude a\ncourt from entering injunctive relief on behalf of a particu-\nlar alien (so long as \u201cproceedings\u201d against the alien have\nbeen \u201cinitiated\u201d), but injunctive relief on behalf of an entire\nclass of aliens is not allowed because it is not limited to rem-\nedying the unlawful \u201capplication\u201d of the relevant statutes\nto \u201can individual alien.\u201d\n                              3\n  On this interpretation of \u00a71252(f )(1), the injunctions en-\ntered by the District Courts in these cases were barred. The\nrespondents in both cases were detained pursuant to\n\u00a71231(a)(6), and no one disputes that \u00a71231(a)(6) is among\nthe provisions the \u201coperation\u201d of which cannot be \u201cenjoined\nor restrained\u201d under \u00a71252(f )(1). Both District Courts en-\ntered injunctions requiring the Government to provide bond\nhearings not only for respondents but also for all other class\nmembers.1 Those orders \u201cenjoin or restrain the operation\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 See Gonzalez v.

Those in-\njunctions thus interfere with the Government\u2019s efforts to\noperate \u00a71231(a)(6), and the injunctions do not fall within\nthe exception for individualized relief because the injunc-\ntions were entered on behalf of entire classes of aliens.2\n                         B\n  Respondents advance two counter-arguments, but both\nfail.\n                               1\n   Respondents first contend that \u201cthe operation\u201d of the cov-\nered immigration provisions means the operation of those\nprovisions \u201cas properly interpreted\u201d and that what\n\u00a71252(f )(1) bars are class-wide injunctions that prohibit the\nGovernment from doing what the statute allows or com-\nmands.

If cars, trucks, rail-\nroads, water utilities, drainage ditches, auto dealerships,\nplanes, radios, video poker machines, cable TV systems,\nand many other things can be unlawfully or improperly op-\nerated, it is not apparent why the same cannot be said of a\nstatute. Thus, the ordinary meaning of the language of\n\u00a71252(f )(1) weighs against respondents\u2019 interpretation.3\n   Apart from ordinary meaning, the statutory context pro-\nvides three additional reasons to reject respondents\u2019 read-\ning. First, respondents\u2019 interpretation, which makes the\nreach of \u00a71252(f )(1) depend on the nature of the claim in\nquestion, clashes with \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s prefatory clause, which\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The dissent agrees that \u201coperation\u201d means \u201cfunctioning\u201d or \u201cworking,\u201d\n\nbut it claims that \u201cunlawful agency action is not a part of the functioning\nor working of the authorizing statute.\u201d Post, at 4 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,\nJ.). The reason that statutes cannot be operated unlawfully, according\nto the dissent, is this: \u201c[A] statute is the law. Officials may implement a\nstatute unlawfully, but a statute does not operate in conflict with itself.\u201d\nPost, at 11. But because to \u201cimplement\u201d a statute is to \u201ccarry out\u201d that\nstatute, Random House Dictionary of the English Language 715 (2d ed.\n1987); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1134 (1993), the\ndissent\u2019s concession that a statute can be \u201cimplement[ed]\u201d \u201cunlawfully\u201d\nis quite damaging to its position. The dissent asserts, but never explains\nwhy, the same cannot be said of a statute\u2019s \u201coperation.\u201d\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

Preap, 586 U. S. ___,\n___ (2019) (slip op., at 4) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment).\n   Second, respondents\u2019 interpretation would limit\n\u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s restriction to a most unlikely set of claims.\nWith perhaps a few small exceptions,4 the only claims to\nwhich \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s prohibition would apply are constitu-\ntional claims. But it would be most unusual for Congress\nto disfavor constitutional claims in this way. Cf. Webster v.\nDoe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112097\"><a href=\"/opinion/112097/webster-v-doe/\">486 U.

And if Congress had wanted to target\njust constitutional claims, it could have surely made the\npoint more directly. The suggestion that Congress sought\nto achieve that goal by using the term \u201coperation\u201d is far-\nfetched.\n   Third, respondents\u2019 interpretation would make a court\u2019s\njurisdiction to entertain a request for class-wide injunctive\nrelief dependent upon the merits of the claim. Under re-\nspondents\u2019 reading, if a complaint sought class-wide relief\non the ground that the Government was misinterpreting\nand misapplying a covered statutory provision, the court\nwould proceed to adjudicate the merits of that claim and\nmight even hold a trial.

See Brief for Respond-\nents 52; see also post, at 12\u201313. Respondents hypothesize a situation in\nwhich a non-immigration statute, or some immigration statute not spec-\nified in \u00a71252(f )(1), might require injunctive relief against the enforce-\nment of one of the covered immigration provisions. Their brief cited no\ncase in which such a situation has ever arisen. At oral argument counsel\nfor respondents did reference one case, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 34\u201335 (refer-\nencing Gonzales v.

It is possible that \u00a71252(f )(1) simply uses different\nlanguage to bar class-wide injunctive relief and extends no\nfurther.

But the\ndissent\u2019s interpretation would mean that \u00a71252(f )(1) precludes injunc-\ntive relief for a plaintiff \u2019s statutory claim if, but only if, that claim al-\nready independently fails on the merits.

The provision\nstates:\n    \u201c(f ) Limit on injunctive relief\n       \u201c(1) In general\n       \u201cRegardless of the nature of the action or claim or of\n    the identity of the party or parties bringing the action,\n    no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have ju-\n    risdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the opera-\n    tion of [\u00a7\u00a71221\u20131232], as amended by the Illegal Immi-\n    gration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n    1996, other than with respect to the application of such\n    provisions to an individual alien against whom pro-\n    ceedings under such part have been initiated.\u201d\n  Section 1252(f )(1) includes two operative clauses: a pri-\nmary clause that strips courts of authority \u201cto enjoin or re-\nstrain the operation of \u201d the specified provisions of the INA,\n\f4             GARLAND v.

The Court holds otherwise only by\ndisregarding the language Congress used in \u00a71252(f )(1) it-\nself, elsewhere in \u00a71252, and in the INA as a whole.\n                               A\n                               1\n   Section 1252(f )(1)\u2019s primary clause provides that the\nlower federal courts may not \u201cenjoin or restrain the opera-\ntion of \u201d the specified provisions of the INA. An injunction\nthat compels the Executive Branch to comply with the spec-\nified provisions (or, phrased differently, prohibits the un-\nlawful implementation of the specified provisions) does not\n\u201cenjoin or restrain\u201d the \u201coperation\u201d of those provisions.\n   This is clear as a matter of plain meaning. Starting with\nthe word \u201coperation,\u201d all agree that the ordinary meaning\nof \u201coperation\u201d is \u201cfunctioning\u201d or \u201cworking.\u201d Ante, at 5. An\ninjunction requiring the Executive Branch to conform its\nconduct with a statute or to cease statutorily unauthorized\nconduct does not enjoin or restrain the \u201cfunctioning or\nworking\u201d of the statute. That is because unlawful agency\naction is not a part of the functioning or working of the au-\nthorizing statute.\n   The Government responds that \u201coperation,\u201d as used in\n\u00a71252(f )(1), is synonymous with \u201cimplementation,\u201d which\nmay include either lawful or unlawful implementation.\nThis contention, however, disregards Congress\u2019 careful\nchoice of language. Section 1252(f )(1) says nothing about\nenjoining or restraining the Executive Branch\u2019s \u201cimplemen-\ntation\u201d of the law.

As explained, however,\nthe most natural and contextual reading of the provision\u2019s\nprimary clause does not limit federal courts\u2019 authority to\nenjoin or restrain agency action unauthorized by statute, or\nto compel agency action commanded by a statute. The\nclause contains nothing approaching the clear command\nnecessary, under centuries of this Court\u2019s precedents, to\ndisplace that authority.\n                              2\n   Independently of \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s primary clause, the provi-\nsion\u2019s saving clause also operates to preserve the lower fed-\neral courts\u2019 equitable authority here. That clause provides\nthat lower courts may enjoin or restrain the operation of the\ncovered statutory provisions \u201cwith respect to the applica-\ntion of such provisions to an individual alien against whom\nproceedings under such part have been initiated.\u201d\n\u00a71252(f )(1). Each beneficiary of the injunctions in these\ncases is \u201can individual alien against whom [removal] pro-\nceedings . . . have been initiated.\u201d Ibid. Under these cir-\ncumstances, \u00a71252(f )(1) poses no barrier to classwide in-\njunctive relief.\n   The Government contends that the phrase \u201can individual\nalien\u201d is inconsistent with injunctive relief on a classwide\nbasis. A class action, however, is a collection of individual\nclaims. See, e.g., Califano v.

In \u00a71252(f )(1), however, it made no mention of\nclass actions or Rule 23. Again, \u201c \u2018it is generally presumed\nthat Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the dis-\nparate inclusion or exclusion\u2019 \u201d of language, particularly\nwhere, as here, it enacted the language as part of a unified\nwhole.

Additionally, the Gov-\nernment\u2019s redundancy concern is particularly unpersuasive\n\f10             GARLAND v. ALEMAN GONZALEZ\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nbecause Congress used the adjective \u201cindividual\u201d redun-\ndantly in other immigration-related provisions within Title\n8. See \u00a71446(a) (authorizing the Attorney General to waive\ninvestigation of applicant for naturalization \u201cin an individ-\nual case or in such cases or classes of cases as may be des-\nignated by him\u201d); \u00a71601(4) (expressing concern that \u201cindi-\nvidual aliens,\u201d prior to 1996, were \u201cburden[ing] the public\nbenefits system\u201d).\n                               3\n   In sum, the courts below retained their equitable author-\nity to issue classwide injunctive relief for two independent\nreasons. First, the relief the District Courts issued did not\npurport \u201cto enjoin or restrain the operation of \u201d any statute;\nrather, the District Courts sought to enforce a statute and\nenjoin what they deemed to be unlawful agency action. Sec-\nond, and in any event, the injunctive relief issued below fell\nwithin \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s saving clause because it concerned only\nthe application of provisions of the INA to individual noncit-\nizens in removal proceedings.\n   This interpretation is a reasonable one. Congress\u2019 ex-\npress and particular use of words in \u00a71252(f )(1) protected\nthe specified statutory provisions against restraint by lower\ncourt injunctions, but evinced no quarrel with lower courts\nensuring that the Executive Branch complied with the com-\nmands in those provisions. In addition, Congress ensured\nthat this goal did not come at the expense of violating the\nrights of noncitizens in removal proceedings.\n                            B\n  The Court reaches a contrary result only by prioritizing\nunavailing and largely atextual concerns.\n                              1\n   Starting with the primary \u201cenjoin or restrain the opera-\ntion of \u201d clause, the Court accepts the Government\u2019s argu-\nment that \u201cthe \u2018operation of \u2019 the relevant statutes is best\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

Aside from ignoring Con-\ngress\u2019 choice to restrict judicial review of \u201cimplementation\u201d\nin some subsections of \u00a71252 but not others, the Court mis-\napprehends how statutes operate. No doubt, \u201claws ordinar-\nily \u2018work\u2019 or \u2018function\u2019 . . . through the actions of officials or\nother persons who implement them.\u201d Ante, at 5. That prop-\nosition, however, only holds if those individuals properly\nimplement the relevant statute. An unlawful implementa-\ntion of a statute is not the \u201cwork[ing]\u201d or \u201cfunction[ing]\u201d of\nthe statute at all; it is simply unauthorized. Restraining\nsuch action does not interfere with the operation of the stat-\nute for purposes of \u00a71252(f )(1).\n   Resisting this result, the Court offers a string cite of sev-\neral inapt uses of \u201coperation,\u201d none of which concern the op-\neration of legal authority. See ante, at 7\u20138. The Court won-\nders why, \u201c[i]f cars, trucks, railroads, water utilities,\ndrainage ditches, auto dealerships, planes, radios, video\npoker machines, cable TV systems, and many other things\ncan be unlawfully or improperly operated, . . . the same can-\nnot be said of a statute.\u201d Ante, at 8. The answer is obvious:\nUnlike all of those examples, a statute is the law. Officials\nmay implement a statute unlawfully, but a statute does not\noperate in conflict with itself.5\n   The Court also agrees with the Government that \u201cenjoin,\u201d\nas used in \u00a71252(f )(1), necessarily takes on both affirmative\nand negative connotations, but only by rigidly segmenting\neach word in the clause, defining each in isolation, and add-\ning those definitions together. See ante, at 4. Elsewhere,\nhowever, this Court has cautioned against such a piecemeal\napproach to statutory interpretation. Cf., e.g., FCC v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The Court\u2019s sole response is to suggest that if an official can \u201c \u2018carry\n\nout\u2019 \u201d a statute contrary to its terms, the statute should be able to \u201c \u2018op-\nerat[e]\u2019 \u201d contrary to itself, too. Ante, at 8, n. 3. This once again elides\nthe distinction Congress drew in \u00a71252 between \u201cimplementation\u201d and\n\u201coperation,\u201d a difference that must be given meaning. See supra, at 4\u20135.\n\f12             GARLAND v.

Moreover, the Court pays\nno mind to Congress\u2019 other uses of \u201cenjoin\u201d in \u00a71252 and\nelsewhere in Title 8 as meaning banning or stopping.\n   The Court offers one final purportedly textual basis for\nits strained reading of the primary clause: that it is the only\noption consistent with \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s prefatory clause. See\nante, at 8\u20139; \u00a71252(f )(1) (\u201cRegardless of the nature of the\naction or claim . . . \u201d). The prefatory clause, however, does\nnot purport to expand the scope of \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s restriction;\nit simply makes clear that the restriction must apply to all\nclaims that would otherwise fall within it, without excep-\ntion. See Atlantic Richfield Co., 590 U. S., at ___, n. 5 (slip\nop., at 10, n. 5) (reasoning similarly as to phrase \u201c \u2018without\nregard to the citizenship of the parties or the amount in con-\ntroversy\u2019 \u201d).\n   The Court closes with two policy arguments. It deems it\n\u201cmost unlikely\u201d that Congress would enact a statute that\ndisproportionately limits lower courts\u2019 authority to issue in-\njunctive relief to remedy constitutional claims, a result it\ncontends would flow from respondents\u2019 reading. Ante, at 9.\nThis is in large part a problem of the Court\u2019s own making.\nAs explained, a proper interpretation of \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s saving\nclause preserves lower courts\u2019 authority to issue injunctive\nrelief on constitutional claims, including on a classwide ba-\nsis, so long as all plaintiffs are individuals against whom\nremoval proceedings have been initiated. Moreover, even\nin preenforcement challenges brought by entities or by in-\ndividuals not in removal proceedings, respondents\u2019 reading\nof \u00a71252(f )(1) does not prohibit injunctive relief exclusively\nas to constitutional claims, but also as to claims that arise\nfrom any statutes external to the covered INA provisions\n(for example, a claim that a covered provision violates the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)). See ante, at 9,\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                       13\n\n                         Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nn. 4. The correct reading of \u00a71252(f )(1) evenhandedly pro-\ntects the specified INA provisions from all such external,\npreenforcement, lower court injunctions, whether on statu-\ntory or constitutional grounds, without shielding unlawful\nagency action inconsistent with the specified provisions.\nWhatever the Court may think of the wisdom of that policy,\nit is a perfectly plausible one.\n   The Court also worries that under this reading of\n\u00a71252(f )(1), the inquiry as to whether injunctive relief is\navailable may overlap with the merits of a claim that a cov-\nered provision has been violated.

Once again, such an overlap is far\nfrom unprecedented. Moreover, as the Court implicitly concedes, it will\nnot always be present. As explained, respondents\u2019 interpretation divests\nthe lower courts of authority to issue injunctive relief on external chal-\nlenges to the specified provisions (e.g., a challenge to a specified provision\nbased on RFRA or the Due Process Clause), regardless of the merits of\nthose challenges, unless the saving clause applies.\n\f14             GARLAND v.

The Court opens with lan-\nguage from past cases suggesting support for its interpre-\ntation. See ante, at 5\u20136. None of the cases the Court quotes,\nhowever, presented or decided the scope of \u00a71252(f )(1)\u2019s bar\non injunctive relief.\n   The Court next affords dispositive weight to its class-\nexclusive view of the word \u201cindividual\u201d in \u00a71252(f )(1). See\nante, at 6. The Court distinguishes Califano in a footnote,\nasserting that \u00a71252(f)(1)\u2019s saving clause should be con-\nstrued narrowly because it is an exception to the primary\nclause. See ante, at 11, n. 6. The point, however, is not that\nthe statute interpreted in Califano was identical to\n\u00a71252(f)(1), but that Califano established that a statute\u2019s\nmere use of the word \u201cindividual\u201d does not suffice to pre-\nclude classwide relief. Moreover, the Court overlooks that\nit is \u00a71252(f)(1)\u2019s primary clause (which divests lower courts\nof their \u201c \u2018traditional equitable authority\u2019 \u201d) that constitutes\nan exception to the norm. McQuiggin, 569 U. S., at 397.\nThe Court ignores the clear-statement rule for such dis-\nplacements of courts\u2019 equitable jurisdiction. Califano and\nthe clear-statement rule both instruct that Congress would\nnot have done so much so obliquely, particularly when it\nclearly prohibited class relief in another subsection of the\nsame statute.\n   On the question of Congress\u2019 disparate inclusion and ex-\nclusion of language in \u00a71252 referring to class actions, the\nCourt declines to decide what it thinks. Taking one path, it\nsuggests that one should not \u201cgive much weight to this neg-\native inference.\u201d Ante, at 10.

There is no con-\nceivable benefit in requiring identical claims to be raised in\nseparate, duplicative actions. This bizarre outcome offers\nfurther proof that the Court has erred.\n                              III\n   The ramifications of the Court\u2019s errors should not be ig-\nnored. Today\u2019s holding risks depriving many vulnerable\nnoncitizens of any meaningful opportunity to protect their\nrights.\n   To understand why, consider the practical realities of the\nremoval and detention system. Noncitizens subjected to re-\nmoval proceedings are disproportionately unlikely to be fa-\nmiliar with the U. S. legal system or fluent in the English\nlanguage. Even so, these individuals must navigate the Na-\ntion\u2019s labyrinthine immigration laws without entitlement\nto appointed counsel or legal support. If they are detained,\nlike respondents here, they face particularly daunting hur-\ndles. On average, immigration detention facilities are lo-\ncated significantly farther away from detained individuals\u2019\ncommunities and court proceedings than criminal jails,\nmaking it extraordinarily difficult to secure legal represen-\ntation. Even for those individuals who can locate and afford\ncounsel under these circumstances, such remote confine-\nment impedes evidence gathering and communication with\ncounsel. After traveling (perhaps for hours) to meet with\ndetained clients, attorneys may be barred from doing so due\nto logistical or administrative errors; legal phone calls, too,\nfrequently are nonconfidential, prohibitively costly, or oth-\nerwise unavailable. Exacerbating these challenges, the\n\f16               GARLAND v. ALEMAN GONZALEZ\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nGovernment regularly transfers detained noncitizens be-\ntween facilities, often multiple times.7\n   It is one matter to expect noncitizens facing these obsta-\ncles to defend against their removal in immigration court.\nIt is another entirely to place upon each of them the added\nburden of contesting systemic violations of their rights\nthrough discrete, collateral, federal-court proceedings. In a\ngreat many cases, the inevitable consequence of barring\nclasswide injunctive relief will be that those violations will\ngo unremedied, except as to the few fortunate enough to af-\nford competent collateral counsel or to secure vigorous\npro bono representation. The burdens will fall on those\nleast able to vindicate their rights, as well as the law firms\nand nonprofit organizations that will endeavor to assist as\nmany of these noncitizens as their capacity permits.8\n   If, somehow, a substantial number of noncitizens are able\nto overcome these obstacles and file separate federal law-\nsuits against unlawful removal or detention policies, a dif-\nferent problem will arise.

Section 1252(f )(1) limits lower courts\u2019 authority to \u201cenjoin or\nrestrain,\u201d whereas a declaratory judgment (unlike an injunction) \u201c \u2018is not\nultimately coercive.\u2019 \u201d Steffel v.

ARTEAGA-MARTINEZ\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 19\u2013896.     Argued January 11, 2022\u2014Decided June 13, 2022\nRespondent Antonio Arteaga-Martinez is a citizen of Mexico who was re-\n  moved in July 2012 and reentered the United States in September\n  2012. U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a\n  warrant for Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s arrest in 2018. ICE reinstated Arte-\n  aga-Martinez\u2019s earlier removal order and detained him pursuant to its\n  authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act. See 8 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71231(a). Arteaga-Martinez applied for withholding of removal under\n  \u00a71231(b)(3), as well as relief under regulations implementing the Con-\n  vention Against Torture, based on his fear that he would be persecuted\n  or tortured if he returned to Mexico. An asylum officer determined he\n  had established a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, and the\n  Department of Homeland Security referred him for withholding-only\n  proceedings before an immigration judge.\n     After being detained for four months, Arteaga-Martinez filed a peti-\n  tion for a writ of habeas corpus in District Court challenging, on both\n  statutory and constitutional grounds, his continued detention without\n  a bond hearing. The Government conceded that Arteaga-Martinez\n  would be entitled to a bond hearing after six months of detention based\n  on circuit precedent holding that a noncitizen facing prolonged deten-\n  tion under \u00a71231(a)(6) is entitled by statute to a bond hearing before\n  an immigration judge and must be released unless the Government\n  establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that the noncitizen\n  poses a risk of flight or a danger to the community. The District Court\n  granted relief on Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s statutory claim and ordered the\n  Government to provide Arteaga-Martinez a bond hearing. The Third\n  Circuit summarily affirmed. At the bond hearing, the Immigration\n\f2                 JOHNSON v. ARTEAGA-MARTINEZ\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Judge considered Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s flight risk and dangerousness\n    and ultimately authorized his release pending resolution of his appli-\n    cation for withholding of removal.\nHeld: Section 1231(a)(6) does not require the Government to provide\n noncitizens detained for six months with bond hearings in which the\n Government bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evi-\n dence, that a noncitizen poses a flight risk or a danger to the commu-\n nity. Pp. 4\u201310.\n    (a) Section 1231(a)(6) cannot be read to require the hearing proce-\n dures imposed below. After the entry of a final order of removal\n against a noncitizen, the Government generally must secure the\n noncitizen\u2019s removal during a 90-day removal period, during which the\n Government \u201cshall\u201d detain the noncitizen. 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71231(a)(1), (2).\n Beyond the removal period, \u00a71231(a)(6) defines four categories of\n noncitizens who \u201cmay be detained . . . and, if released, shall be subject\n to [certain] terms of supervision.\u201d There is no plausible construction\n of the text of \u00a71231(a)(6) that requires the Government to provide bond\n hearings with the procedures mandated by the Third Circuit. The\n statute says nothing about bond hearings before immigration judges\n or burdens of proof, nor does it provide any other indication that such\n procedures are required. Faithfully applying precedent, the Court\n cannot discern the bond hearing procedures required below from\n \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s text. Pp. 4\u20136.\n    (b) Arteaga-Martinez argues that \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s references to flight\n risk, dangerousness, and terms of supervision, support the relief or-\n dered below. Similarly, respondents in the companion case, see Gar-\n land v. Gonzalez, 594 U. S. ___, analogize the text of \u00a71231(a)(6) to that\n of 8 U. S. C. \u00a71226(a), noting that noncitizens detained under \u00a71226(a)\n have long received bond hearings at the outset of detention. Assuming\n without deciding that an express statutory reference to \u201cbond\u201d (as in\n \u00a71226(a)) might be read to require an initial bond hearing, \u00a71231(a)(6)\n contains no such reference, and \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s oblique reference to\n terms of supervision does not suffice. The parties agree that the Gov-\n ernment possesses discretion to provide bond hearings under\n \u00a71231(a)(6) or otherwise, but this Court cannot say the statute re-\n quires them.\n    Finally, Arteaga-Martinez argues that Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S.\n 678, which identified ambiguity in \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s permissive language,\n supports a view that \u00a71231(a)(6) implicitly incorporates the specific\n bond hearing requirements and procedures imposed by the Court of\n Appeals. In Zadvydas, this Court construed \u00a71231(a)(6) \u201cin light of the\n Constitution\u2019s demands\u201d and determined that \u00a71231(a)(6) \u201cdoes not\n permit indefinite detention\u201d but instead \u201climits an alien\u2019s post-re-\n moval-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

The\n  bond hearing requirements articulated by the Third Circuit, however,\n  reach substantially beyond the limitation on detention authority\n  Zadvydas recognized. Zadvydas does not require, and Jennings v. Ro-\n  driguez, 583 U. S. ___, does not permit, the Third Circuit\u2019s application\n  of the canon of constitutional avoidance. Pp. 6\u20138.\n     (c) Constitutional challenges to prolonged detention under\n  \u00a71231(a)(6) were not addressed below, in part because those courts\n  read \u00a71231(a)(6) to require a bond hearing. Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s alter-\n  native theory that he is presumptively entitled to release under\n  Zadvydas also was not addressed below. The Court leaves these argu-\n  ments for the lower courts to consider in the first instance. See Cutter\n  v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7.

This Court recently held that\n\u00a71231(a) applies to individuals who are removed and who\nthen reenter without authorization and apply for withhold-\ning of removal based on a fear that they will be persecuted\nor tortured if returned to their countries of origin. See\nJohnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip\nop., at 1). The issue in this case is whether the text of\n\u00a71231(a)(6) requires the Government to offer detained\nnoncitizens bond hearings after six months of detention in\nwhich the Government bears the burden of proving by clear\nand convincing evidence that a noncitizen poses a flight risk\nor a danger to the community. It does not.\n\f2             JOHNSON v. ARTEAGA-MARTINEZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n   Respondent Antonio Arteaga-Martinez is a citizen of\nMexico. He admits that he has entered the United States\nwithout inspection four times. He first entered in March\n2001 and was detained at the border and removed; he reen-\ntered in April of that year. Ten years later, in 2011, he left\nthe country to care for his sick mother, reentering in July\nof the following year. The Government again detained him\nat the border, determined he was inadmissible, and re-\nmoved him.\n   Arteaga-Martinez represents that, after returning to\nMexico, he was beaten violently by members of a criminal\nstreet gang. Fearing that he would be persecuted or tor-\ntured again with the acquiescence of government officials,\nhe reentered the United States in September 2012.\n   In May 2018, U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-\nment (ICE) issued a warrant for Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s arrest.\nBy then, he had been living and working in the United\nStates for nearly six years and was expecting the birth of\nhis first child. He had no criminal record aside from minor\ntraffic violations. ICE detained Arteaga-Martinez without\nany opportunity for bond and reinstated his earlier removal\norder.\n   Arteaga-Martinez applied for withholding of removal un-\nder \u00a71231(b)(3), as well as relief under regulations imple-\nmenting the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10,\n1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100\u201320, 1465 U. N. T. S. 113. The\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) referred Arteaga-\nMartinez to an asylum officer, who found that Arteaga-\nMartinez\u2019s testimony was credible and that he had estab-\nlished a reasonable fear of persecution or torture. As a re-\nsult, DHS referred Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s claims for adjudica-\ntion by an immigration judge in what we have called\n\u201cwithholding-only proceedings.\u201d Guzman Chavez, 594\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). Pending these proceedings,\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever, the Government continued to detain Arteaga-\nMartinez pursuant to \u00a71231(a)(6).1\n   In September 2018, after he had been detained for four\nmonths without a hearing, Arteaga-Martinez filed a peti-\ntion for a writ of habeas corpus in the U. S. District Court\nfor the Middle District of Pennsylvania. His petition chal-\nlenged his continued detention without a bond hearing on\nboth statutory and constitutional grounds. Shortly there-\nafter, in a separate case, the Third Circuit held that a\nnoncitizen facing prolonged detention under \u00a71231(a)(6) is\nentitled by statute to a bond hearing before an immigration\njudge and must be released from detention unless the Gov-\nernment establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that\nthe noncitizen poses a risk of flight or a danger to the com-\nmunity. See Guerrero-Sanchez v. Warden York County\nPrison, 905 F. 3d 208, 224, and n. 12 (2018).\n   The Government conceded that under Guerrero-Sanchez,\nArteaga-Martinez would be entitled to a bond hearing pur-\nsuant to \u00a71231(a)(6) as of November 4, 2018, six months af-\nter the start of his detention. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a.\nOnce Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s time in detention had reached\nnearly six months, a Magistrate Judge recommended that\nthe District Court grant a writ of habeas corpus on Arteaga-\nMartinez\u2019s statutory claim and order the Government to\nprovide him an individualized bond hearing before an im-\nmigration judge. Id., at 4a\u20135a. The District Court adopted\nthe report and recommendation and ordered a bond hear-\ning. Id., at 3a.\n   The Government appealed. The Court of Appeals sum-\nmarily affirmed, citing its earlier decision in Guerrero-\nSanchez. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a\u20132a. Arteaga-Mar-\ntinez received a bond hearing at which an Immigration\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Arteaga-Martinez represents, and the Government does not dispute,\n\nthat the Government conducted an administrative review of his danger-\nousness and flight risk in August 2018 and denied him release without\ninterviewing him or providing a hearing. See 8 CFR \u00a7241.4(h)(1) (2021).\n\f4                JOHNSON v. ARTEAGA-MARTINEZ\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nJudge, considering Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s flight risk and dan-\ngerousness, authorized his release on bond. Arteaga-Mar-\ntinez posted bond and was released pending a final deter-\nmination on his application for withholding of removal,\nwhich, as of today, the Immigration Judge has yet to make.\nPet. for Cert. 6; Brief for Respondent 10\u201311.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 594 U. S. ___ (2021).2\n                              II\n                              A\n  The INA establishes procedures for the Government to\nuse when removing certain noncitizens from the United\nStates and, in some cases, detaining them. The section at\nissue here, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71231(a), governs the detention, re-\nlease, and removal of individuals \u201cordered removed.\u201d This\nCourt has held that \u00a71231(a) applies to individuals with\npending withholding-only proceedings.          See Guzman\nChavez, 594 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 7\u20138).\n  After the entry of a final order of removal against a\nnoncitizen, the Government generally must secure the\nnoncitizen\u2019s removal during a 90-day \u201c \u2018removal period.\u2019 \u201d\n\u00a71231(a)(1)(A). The statute provides that the Government\n\u201cshall\u201d detain noncitizens during the statutory removal pe-\nriod. \u00a71231(a)(2). After the removal period expires, the\nGovernment \u201cmay\u201d detain only four categories of people:\n(1) those who are \u201cinadmissible\u201d on certain specified\ngrounds; (2) those who are \u201cremovable\u201d on certain specified\ngrounds; (3) those it determines \u201cto be a risk to the commu-\nnity\u201d; and (4) those it determines to be \u201cunlikely to comply\nwith the order of removal.\u201d \u00a71231(a)(6). Individuals re-\nleased after the removal period remain subject to terms of\nsupervision. Ibid.\n  Section 1231(a)(6) does not expressly specify how long de-\ntention past the 90-day removal period may continue for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Court also granted certiorari in a companion case presenting the\n\nsame question. See Garland v. Gonzalez, 594 U. S. ___ (2021).\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthose who fall within the four designated statutory catego-\nries. In Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678 (2001), the Court\nobserved that the statute\u2019s use of the term \u201cmay\u201d introduces\nsome ambiguity and \u201cdoes not necessarily suggest unlim-\nited discretion.\u201d Id., at 697. The Court explained that \u201c[a]\nstatute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would\nraise a serious constitutional problem,\u201d noting that it had\nupheld noncriminal detention as consistent with the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment only under certain\nnarrow circumstances. Id., at 690. Accordingly, the Court\napplied the canon of constitutional avoidance and deter-\nmined that \u201cread in light of the Constitution\u2019s demands,\u201d\n\u00a71231(a)(6) \u201cdoes not permit indefinite detention\u201d but in-\nstead \u201climits an alien\u2019s post-removal-period detention to a\nperiod reasonably necessary to bring about that alien\u2019s re-\nmoval from the United States.\u201d Id., at 689.\n   Subsequently, in Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___\n(2018), this Court considered the text of other provisions of\nthe INA that authorize detention. One such provision was\n\u00a71226(a), which governs the detention of certain nonciti-\nzens present in the country who were inadmissible at the\ntime of entry or who have been convicted of certain criminal\noffenses since they were admitted. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n4). Section 1226(a) provides that the attorney general\n\u201cmay\u201d detain these noncitizens pending their removal pro-\nceedings and \u201cmay release\u201d such individuals on \u201cbond . . . or\nconditional parole.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71226(a)(1), (2). Nonciti-\nzens detained under \u00a71226(a) receive bond hearings after\nthe Government initially detains them. See 8 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a7236.1(d)(1), 1236.1(d)(1) (2021). Relying on Zadvydas,\nthe Ninth Circuit had interpreted \u00a71226(a) to require addi-\ntional, periodic bond hearings every six months, with the\nburden on the Government to prove by clear and convincing\nevidence that further detention was justified. Jennings,\n583 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 22\u201323). The Court in Jen-\nnings disagreed. It held that \u201cthe meaning of the relevant\n\f6             JOHNSON v. ARTEAGA-MARTINEZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatutory provisio[n] is clear\u201d and that it did not support a\nperiodic bond hearing requirement. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n23).\n   The Jennings Court also rejected the lower court\u2019s appli-\ncation of the canon of constitutional avoidance. Earlier in\nits opinion, the Court explained that \u201c[t]he canon of consti-\ntutional avoidance \u2018comes into play only when, after the ap-\nplication of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found\nto be susceptible of more than one construction.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 12) (quoting Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371,\n385 (2005)). \u201cIn the absence of more than one plausible con-\nstruction, the canon simply has no application. \u201d Jennings,\n583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Applying this reasoning to \u00a71226(a), the Court\nconcluded that the canon was inapposite because \u201c[n]othing\nin \u00a71226(a)\u2019s text . . . even remotely supports the imposition\nof either of th[e] requirements\u201d the Ninth Circuit had im-\nposed. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 23).\n                              B\n   The question presented is whether \u00a71231(a)(6) requires\nbond hearings before immigration judges after six months\nof detention in which the Government bears the burden of\nproving by clear and convincing evidence that a noncitizen\nposes a flight risk or a danger to the community. Section\n1231(a)(6) provides that certain noncitizens who have been\nordered removed \u201cmay be detained beyond the removal pe-\nriod and, if released, shall be subject to [certain] terms of\nsupervision.\u201d This text, which does not address or \u201ceven\nhin[t]\u201d at the requirements imposed below, directs that we\nanswer this question in the negative. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n14).\n  The Jennings Court emphasized that the canon of consti-\ntutional avoidance is only applicable where a statute has\n\u201cmore than one plausible construction.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12). Here, there is no plausible construction of the text\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof \u00a71231(a)(6) that requires the Government to provide\nbond hearings before immigration judges after six months\nof detention, with the Government bearing the burden of\nproving by clear and convincing evidence that a detained\nnoncitizen poses a flight risk or a danger to the community.\nSection 1231(a)(6) provides only that a noncitizen ordered\nremoved \u201cmay be detained beyond the removal period\u201d and\nif released, \u201cshall be subject to [certain] terms of supervi-\nsion.\u201d On its face, the statute says nothing about bond hear-\nings before immigration judges or burdens of proof, nor does\nit provide any other indication that such procedures are re-\nquired. Faithfully applying our precedent, the Court can no\nmore discern such requirements from the text of \u00a71231(a)(6)\nthan a periodic bond hearing requirement from the text of\n\u00a71226(a). See id., at ___ (slip op., at 23). Section 1231(a)(6)\ntherefore cannot be read to incorporate the procedures im-\nposed by the courts below as a matter of textual command.\n   Arteaga-Martinez responds that \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s references\nto flight risk, dangerousness, and \u201c \u2018terms of supervision\u2019 \u201d\nsupport the relief ordered below. Brief for Respondent 29\u2013\n30. Similarly, respondents in the companion case analogize\nthe text of \u00a71231(a)(6) to that of \u00a71226(a), and they note that\nnoncitizens detained under \u00a71226(a) have long received\nbond hearings at the outset of detention. Brief for Respond-\nents in Garland v. Gonzalez, O. T. 2021, No. 20\u2013322,\npp. 22\u201324. However, assuming without deciding that an ex-\npress statutory reference to \u201cbond\u201d (as in \u00a71226(a)) might\nbe read to require an initial bond hearing, \u00a71231(a)(6) con-\ntains no such reference. A more oblique reference to terms\nof supervision does not suffice.\n   Respondents in the companion case also emphasize that\nregulations offer custody hearings before immigration\njudges for noncitizens the Government detains under\n\u00a71231(a)(6) because it deems them \u201cspecially dangerous.\u201d\nSee 8 CFR \u00a7241.14; Brief for Respondents in No. 20\u2013322, at\n16, 25\u201326. They argue that if the statute can allow custody\n\f8                JOHNSON v. ARTEAGA-MARTINEZ\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhearings for these individuals, it requires such hearings for\nthose in Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s situation as well. Federal\nagencies, however, \u201care free to grant additional procedural\nrights in the exercise of their discretion.\u201d Vermont Yankee\nNuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 435 U. S. 519, 524 (1978). \u201c[R]eviewing courts,\u201d on the\nother hand, \u201care generally not free to impose them if the\nagencies have not chosen to grant them.\u201d Ibid. The parties\ndo not dispute that the Government possesses discretion to\nprovide bond hearings under \u00a71231(a)(6), see Brief for Peti-\ntioners 15, but this Court cannot say, consistent with Jen-\nnings, that the statutory text requires them.\n   Finally, Arteaga-Martinez argues that Zadvydas, which\nidentified ambiguity in \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s permissive language,\nsupports a view that \u00a71231(a)(6) implicitly incorporates the\nspecific bond hearing requirements and procedures enu-\nmerated by the Court of Appeals. In Jennings, however,\nthis Court faulted the Ninth Circuit for going significantly\nfurther than Zadvydas. 583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).\nJennings did not overrule or abrogate Zadvydas. But the\ndetailed procedural requirements imposed by the Court of\nAppeals below reach substantially beyond the limitation on\ndetention authority recognized in Zadvydas. Zadvydas\ndoes not require, and Jennings does not permit, the Third\nCircuit\u2019s application of the canon of constitutional avoid-\nance.3\n                             C\n  Separately from his statutory claims, Arteaga-Martinez\ncontends that reading \u00a71231(a)(6) not to require bond hear-\nings when detention becomes prolonged \u201craises serious due\nprocess concerns.\u201d Brief for Respondent 24. He points out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Because the text of 8 U. S. C. \u00a71231(a)(6) does not require the relief\n\nordered below, the Court does not address the parties\u2019 disagreements\nover whether that relief contravened \u00a71231(h) or impermissibly reallo-\ncated executive authority.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat outside of the national-security context, this Court has\nnever \u201cauthorized prolonged detention without an individ-\nualized hearing, before a neutral adjudicator, at which the\ndetainee has a meaningful opportunity to participate.\u201d\nIbid. (collecting cases). He asserts that the Government\u2019s\ninterest in denying bond hearings is minimal because such\nhearings do not require release. Id., at 26 (citing Zadvydas,\n533 U. S., at 696). And he argues that his status as an in-\ndividual with a reinstated removal order \u201c \u2018bears no relation\nto [his] dangerousness,\u2019 \u201d as evidenced by the fact that an\nImmigration Judge authorized his release on bond. Brief\nfor Respondent 26\u201327 (quoting Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at\n692). The Government responds that regulations directing\nICE officials to conduct administrative custody reviews for\nindividuals in ICE detention provide adequate process, \u201cat\nleast as a general matter.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 18\u201319. The\nGovernment contends that these regulations\u2014which gen-\nerally require a custody review at the end of the 90-day re-\nmoval period, a second review by a panel at ICE headquar-\nters after six months of detention, and subsequent annual\nreviews\u2014provide constitutionally sufficient substantive\nand procedural protections for noncitizens whose detention\nis prolonged. Id., at 18. The Government also notes that\nas-applied constitutional challenges remain available to ad-\ndress \u201cexceptional\u201d cases. Id., at 21.\n   \u201c[W]e are a court of review, not of first view.\u201d Cutter v.\nWilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005). The courts below\ndid not reach Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s constitutional claims be-\ncause they agreed with him that the statute required a bond\nhearing. We leave them for the lower courts to consider in\nthe first instance. See Jennings, 583 U.

ARTEAGA-MARTINEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproceedings tend to take, his removal is not reasonably fore-\nseeable. See Brief for Respondent 19\u201322.

Under 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71252(b)(9), a federal court has jurisdiction to re-\nview \u201cquestions of law and fact . . . arising from any action\ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien . . . only\u201d in\ntwo circumstances: (1) when the court reviews a \u201cfinal or-\nder\u201d of removal, or (2) when \u00a71252 otherwise grants juris-\ndiction. See, e.g., Johnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 U. S. ___,\n___ (2021) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment) (slip op., at 1); Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583\nU. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (same) (slip op., at 3\u20134).

Nonetheless, \u201cbecause the Court has held that\nwe have jurisdiction in cases like these, and the Court\u2019s\nopinion is otherwise correct,\u201d I join it in full. Guzman\nChavez, 594 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n                              II\n   Second, as I have explained elsewhere, there is consider-\nable historical evidence that the Due Process Clause does\nnot \u201capply to laws governing the removal of aliens.\u201d Ses-\nsions v. Dimaya, 584 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (dissenting opin-\nion) (slip op., at 6). But even assuming the Due Process\nClause extends to some aliens contesting their removabil-\nity, it does not protect from detention an alien who, like\nArteaga-Martinez, does not challenge his final removal or-\nder. Illegal aliens deemed removable have no \u201cright of re-\nlease into this country.\u201d Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678,\n703 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Although the Court\nproperly declines to decide Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s due process\nclaim, see ante, at 9, we should revisit whether the Due Pro-\ncess Clause applies at all in this context.\n                              III\n  Third, this case illustrates why we should overrule\nZadvydas at the earliest opportunity. There, the Court held\nthat \u00a71231(a)(6) \u201cwould raise a serious constitutional prob-\nlem\u201d under the Fifth Amendment if it permitted \u201cindefinite\ndetention of an alien.\u201d Id., at 690. To avoid that supposed\n\u201cproblem,\u201d the Court deemed \u201cambiguous\u201d the statutory au-\nthorization that a removable alien \u201cmay be detained beyond\nthe removal period,\u201d and then, clothed in constitutional\ngarb, invoked that manufactured ambiguity to graft a\nmade-up rule onto \u00a71231(a)(6). Id., at 697. Namely, the\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

The \u201cpresumptively reasonable\u201d detention period, the\nCourt declared, was six months. Id., at 701. The Court of-\nfered no textual support for that (or any) length of time. See\nibid.\n   As we later implied in Jennings, the constitutional-avoid-\nance canon cannot justify adoption of such an implausible\nconstruction of \u00a71231(a)(6). See 583 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12). And, until we overrule Zadvydas, it will continue to\ninvite nothing but mischief.           An ill-defined, quasi-\nconstitutional command of \u201creasonableness\u201d inevitably en-\ncourages courts to fashion procedural rules with no basis in\nstatutory text. We confronted that mischief in Jennings,\nsee 583 U.

S. C. \u00a71231(a).\nHowever, \u00a71231(a)(6) provides that the Attorney General\nmay sometimes hold such a person in custody for a longer\nperiod. It says:\n    \u201cAn alien ordered removed [1] who is inadmissible [2]\n    [or] removable [as a result of violations of status re-\n    quirements or entry conditions, certain violations of\n    criminal law, or reasons of security or foreign policy] or\n    [3] who has been determined by the Attorney General\n    to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with\n    the order of removal, may be detained beyond the re-\n    moval period . . . .\u201d\n  In Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 689 (2001), \u201cwe read\nan implicit limitation into\u201d this provision. Because a \u201cstat-\nute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would raise\na serious constitutional problem,\u201d we held that the \u201cstatute,\nread in light of the Constitution\u2019s demands, limits an alien\u2019s\n\f2             JOHNSON v. ARTEAGA-MARTINEZ\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\npost-removal-period detention to a period reasonably neces-\nsary to bring about that alien\u2019s removal from the United\nStates. It does not permit indefinite detention.\u201d Id., at 689\u2013\n690; see also id., at 690\u2013696 (explaining potential constitu-\ntional concerns presented by indefinite detention under\n\u00a71231(a)(6)).\n   We also held that the period reasonably necessary to ef-\nfect removal was presumptively six months. Id., at 701.\n\u201c[W]e recognize[d] that period\u201d \u201cfor the sake of uniform ad-\nministration in the federal courts.\u201d Ibid. But \u201c[a]fter this\n6-month period, once the alien provides good reason to be-\nlieve that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the\nreasonably foreseeable future, the Government must re-\nspond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing. And\nfor detention to remain reasonable, as the period of prior\npostremoval confinement grows, what counts as the \u2018rea-\nsonably foreseeable future\u2019 conversely would have to\nshrink.\u201d Ibid.\n   In my view, Zadvydas controls the outcome here. The\nstatutory language is identical, which is not surprising, for\nthis case concerns the same statutory provision. There are\ntwo conceivable differences between this case and\nZadvydas, but both argue in favor of applying Zadvydas\u2019\nholding here.\n   First, the respondent here, Antonio Arteaga-Martinez,\nhas been ordered removed, and is therefore subject to\n\u00a71231(a), for a different reason than the persons whose\ncases we considered in Zadvydas. Kestutis Zadvydas and\nKim Ho Ma were ordered removed because they had been\nconvicted of serious crimes. Id., at 684\u2013685. Zadvydas had\ncommitted drug crimes, attempted robbery, attempted bur-\nglary, and theft; Ma was involved in a gang-related shoot-\ning and convicted of manslaughter. Ibid. Arteaga-Mar-\ntinez\u2019s only crime (besides minor traffic violations) is\nentering the United States without inspection. Ante, at 2.\nThe Government seeks to detain him while an immigration\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

There is\nless reason, not more, to detain Arteaga-Martinez without\nbail.\n   Second, Zadvydas provided for outright release, 533\nU. S., at 699\u2013700; this case involves a bail hearing. Again,\nthe Government has less reason to detain a person when\nthe alternative is a bail hearing (where the Government has\nan opportunity to show that that person might pose a dan-\nger to the community or a flight risk) than when the alter-\nnative is simply release.\n   The Government argues that a later case, Jennings v. Ro-\ndriguez, 583 U. S. ___ (2018), dictates the result here, ra-\nther than Zadvydas. Not at all. That later case involved\ndetention under statutes other than the one at issue here\nand in Zadvydas. Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5)\n(\u201cThe primary issue is the proper interpretation of\n\u00a7\u00a71225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c)\u201d). The Court in Jennings\ndid not modify or overrule Zadvydas, but rather explicitly\ndistinguished that case. Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 17). It did so on multiple grounds, including the fact\nthat almost all of the statutes at issue in Jennings used\nwords that mandated detention, such as \u201cshall,\u201d rather\nthan words of discretion, such as \u201cmay.\u201d Id., at ___, ___ (slip\nop., at 16, 19). In Zadvydas, the word \u201cmay\u201d created ambi-\nguity that permitted the Court to interpret \u00a71231(a)(6) (the\nstatute before us) in a manner that avoided the constitu-\ntional problem that indefinite detention could have created.\n533 U. S., at 697. The majority in Jennings held that the\nstatutory provisions at issue there were not similarly am-\nbiguous, and therefore did not permit the Court to reach a\nsimilar interpretation. 583 U. S., at ___, ___\u2013___ (slip op.,\nat 17, 22\u201323).\n   It is true that one of the statutes interpreted in Jennings,\n\u00a71226(a), said that the Attorney General \u201cmay . . . arres[t]\n\f4              JOHNSON v.

Here is the Court\u2019s answer to that\nquestion in its entirety:\n    \u201cThe Court of Appeals ordered the Government to pro-\n    vide procedural protections that go well beyond the in-\n    itial bond hearing established by existing regulations\u2014\n    namely, periodic bond hearings every six months in\n    which the Attorney General must prove by clear and\n    convincing evidence that the alien\u2019s continued deten-\n    tion is necessary. Nothing in \u00a71226(a)\u2019s text\u2014which\n    says only that the Attorney General \u2018may release\u2019 the\n    alien \u2018on . . . bond\u2019\u2014even remotely supports the impo-\n    sition of either of those requirements. Nor does\n    \u00a71226(a)\u2019s text even hint that the length of detention\n    prior to a bond hearing must specifically be considered\n    in determining whether the alien should be released.\u201d\n    Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 22\u201323) (em-\n    phasis added).\n   The court below did not order periodic bond hearings, but\nit did require the Government to satisfy a \u201cclear and con-\nvincing evidence\u201d standard. Ante, at 3. I agree that Jen-\nnings forecloses this latter requirement. Otherwise, I\nwould find the lower courts\u2019 bail hearing requirements rea-\nsonable implementations of the Zadvydas standard, which\nis applicable here.\n   Since the Court remands this case for further proceed-\nings, I would add that, in my view, Zadvydas applies (the\nCourt does not hold to the contrary), and the parties are free\nto argue about the proper way to implement Zadvydas\u2019\nstandard in this context, and, if necessary, to consider the\nunderlying constitutional question, a matter that this\nCourt has not decided.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2021                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 11, 2022\u2014Decided June 13, 2022\nRespondent Antonio Arteaga-Martinez is a citizen of Mexico who was re-\n  moved in July 2012 and reentered the United States in September\n  2012. U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a\n  warrant for Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s arrest in 2018. ICE reinstated Arte-\n  aga-Martinez\u2019s earlier removal order and detained him pursuant to its\n  authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71231</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a). Arteaga-Martinez applied for withholding of removal under\n  \u00a71231(b)(3), as well as relief under regulations implementing the Con-\n  vention Against Torture, based on his fear that he would be persecuted\n  or tortured if he returned to Mexico. An asylum officer determined he\n  had established a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, and the\n  Department of Homeland Security referred him for withholding-only\n  proceedings before an immigration judge.\n     After being detained for four months, Arteaga-Martinez filed a peti-\n  tion for a writ of habeas corpus in District Court challenging, on both\n  statutory and constitutional grounds, his continued detention without\n  a bond hearing. The Government conceded that Arteaga-Martinez\n  would be entitled to a bond hearing after six months of detention based\n  on circuit precedent holding that a noncitizen facing prolonged deten-\n  tion under \u00a71231(a)(6) is entitled by statute to a bond hearing before\n  an immigration judge and must be released unless the Government\n  establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that the noncitizen\n  poses a risk of flight or a danger to the community. The District Court\n  granted relief on Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s statutory claim and ordered the\n  Government to provide Arteaga-Martinez a bond hearing. The Third\n  Circuit summarily affirmed. At the bond hearing, the Immigration\n\f2                 JOHNSON v. ARTEAGA-MARTINEZ\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Judge considered Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s flight risk and dangerousness\n    and ultimately authorized his release pending resolution of his appli-\n    cation for withholding of removal.\nHeld: Section 1231(a)(6) does not require the Government to provide\n noncitizens detained for six months with bond hearings in which the\n Government bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evi-\n dence, that a noncitizen poses a flight risk or a danger to the commu-\n nity. Pp. 4\u201310.\n    (a) Section 1231(a)(6) cannot be read to require the hearing proce-\n dures imposed below. After the entry of a final order of removal\n against a noncitizen, the Government generally must secure the\n noncitizen\u2019s removal during a 90-day removal period, during which the\n Government \u201cshall\u201d detain the noncitizen. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71231</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(1), (2).\n Beyond the removal period, \u00a71231(a)(6) defines four categories of\n noncitizens who \u201cmay be detained . . . and, if released, shall be subject\n to [certain] terms of supervision.\u201d There is no plausible construction\n of the text of \u00a71231(a)(6) that requires the Government to provide bond\n hearings with the procedures mandated by the Third Circuit. The\n statute says nothing about bond hearings before immigration judges\n or burdens of proof, nor does it provide any other indication that such\n procedures are required. Faithfully applying precedent, the Court\n cannot discern the bond hearing procedures required below from\n \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s text. Pp. 4\u20136.\n    (b) Arteaga-Martinez argues that \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s references to flight\n risk, dangerousness, and terms of supervision, support the relief or-\n dered below. Similarly, respondents in the companion case, see Gar-\n land v. Gonzalez, 594 U. S. ___, analogize the text of \u00a71231(a)(6) to that\n of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 U. S. C. \u00a71226</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a), noting that noncitizens detained under \u00a71226(a)\n have long received bond hearings at the outset of detention. Assuming\n without deciding that an express statutory reference to \u201cbond\u201d (as in\n \u00a71226(a)) might be read to require an initial bond hearing, \u00a71231(a)(6)\n contains no such reference, and \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s oblique reference to\n terms of supervision does not suffice. The parties agree that the Gov-\n ernment possesses discretion to provide bond hearings under\n \u00a71231(a)(6) or otherwise, but this Court cannot say the statute re-\n quires them.\n    Finally, Arteaga-Martinez argues that Zadvydas v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\">533 U. S.\n 678</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which identified ambiguity in \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s permissive language,\n supports a view that \u00a71231(a)(6) implicitly incorporates the specific\n bond hearing requirements and procedures imposed by the Court of\n Appeals. In Zadvydas, this Court construed \u00a71231(a)(6) \u201cin light of the\n Constitution\u2019s demands\u201d and determined that \u00a71231(a)(6) \u201cdoes not\n permit indefinite detention\u201d but instead \u201climits an alien\u2019s post-re-\n moval-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

The\n  bond hearing requirements articulated by the Third Circuit, however,\n  reach substantially beyond the limitation on detention authority\n  Zadvydas recognized. Zadvydas does not require, and Jennings v. Ro-\n  driguez, 583 U. S. ___, does not permit, the Third Circuit\u2019s application\n  of the canon of constitutional avoidance. Pp. 6\u20138.\n     (c) Constitutional challenges to prolonged detention under\n  \u00a71231(a)(6) were not addressed below, in part because those courts\n  read \u00a71231(a)(6) to require a bond hearing. Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s alter-\n  native theory that he is presumptively entitled to release under\n  Zadvydas also was not addressed below.

He admits that he has entered the United States\nwithout inspection four times. He first entered in March\n2001 and was detained at the border and removed; he reen-\ntered in April of that year. Ten years later, in 2011, he left\nthe country to care for his sick mother, reentering in July\nof the following year. The Government again detained him\nat the border, determined he was inadmissible, and re-\nmoved him.\n   Arteaga-Martinez represents that, after returning to\nMexico, he was beaten violently by members of a criminal\nstreet gang. Fearing that he would be persecuted or tor-\ntured again with the acquiescence of government officials,\nhe reentered the United States in September 2012.\n   In May 2018, U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-\nment (ICE) issued a warrant for Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s arrest.\nBy then, he had been living and working in the United\nStates for nearly six years and was expecting the birth of\nhis first child. He had no criminal record aside from minor\ntraffic violations. ICE detained Arteaga-Martinez without\nany opportunity for bond and reinstated his earlier removal\norder.\n   Arteaga-Martinez applied for withholding of removal un-\nder \u00a71231(b)(3), as well as relief under regulations imple-\nmenting the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10,\n1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100\u201320, 1465 U. N. T. S. 113. The\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) referred Arteaga-\nMartinez to an asylum officer, who found that Arteaga-\nMartinez\u2019s testimony was credible and that he had estab-\nlished a reasonable fear of persecution or torture. As a re-\nsult, DHS referred Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s claims for adjudica-\ntion by an immigration judge in what we have called\n\u201cwithholding-only proceedings.\u201d Guzman Chavez, 594\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). Pending these proceedings,\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U.

S. District Court\nfor the Middle District of Pennsylvania. His petition chal-\nlenged his continued detention without a bond hearing on\nboth statutory and constitutional grounds. Shortly there-\nafter, in a separate case, the Third Circuit held that a\nnoncitizen facing prolonged detention under \u00a71231(a)(6) is\nentitled by statute to a bond hearing before an immigration\njudge and must be released from detention unless the Gov-\nernment establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that\nthe noncitizen poses a risk of flight or a danger to the com-\nmunity. See Guerrero-Sanchez v. Warden York County\nPrison, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">905 F. 3d 208</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224, and n. 12 (2018).\n   The Government conceded that under Guerrero-Sanchez,\nArteaga-Martinez would be entitled to a bond hearing pur-\nsuant to \u00a71231(a)(6) as of November 4, 2018, six months af-\nter the start of his detention. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a.\nOnce Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s time in detention had reached\nnearly six months, a Magistrate Judge recommended that\nthe District Court grant a writ of habeas corpus on Arteaga-\nMartinez\u2019s statutory claim and order the Government to\nprovide him an individualized bond hearing before an im-\nmigration judge. Id., at 4a\u20135a. The District Court adopted\nthe report and recommendation and ordered a bond hear-\ning. Id., at 3a.\n   The Government appealed. The Court of Appeals sum-\nmarily affirmed, citing its earlier decision in Guerrero-\nSanchez. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a\u20132a. Arteaga-Mar-\ntinez received a bond hearing at which an Immigration\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Arteaga-Martinez represents, and the Government does not dispute,\n\nthat the Government conducted an administrative review of his danger-\nousness and flight risk in August 2018 and denied him release without\ninterviewing him or providing a hearing.

Arteaga-Mar-\ntinez posted bond and was released pending a final deter-\nmination on his application for withholding of removal,\nwhich, as of today, the Immigration Judge has yet to make.\nPet. for Cert. 6; Brief for Respondent 10\u201311.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 594 U.

The section at\nissue here, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 U. S. C. \u00a71231</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a), governs the detention, re-\nlease, and removal of individuals \u201cordered removed.\u201d This\nCourt has held that \u00a71231(a) applies to individuals with\npending withholding-only proceedings.          See Guzman\nChavez, 594 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 7\u20138).\n  After the entry of a final order of removal against a\nnoncitizen, the Government generally must secure the\nnoncitizen\u2019s removal during a 90-day \u201c \u2018removal period.\u2019 \u201d\n\u00a71231(a)(1)(A). The statute provides that the Government\n\u201cshall\u201d detain noncitizens during the statutory removal pe-\nriod. \u00a71231(a)(2). After the removal period expires, the\nGovernment \u201cmay\u201d detain only four categories of people:\n(1) those who are \u201cinadmissible\u201d on certain specified\ngrounds; (2) those who are \u201cremovable\u201d on certain specified\ngrounds; (3) those it determines \u201cto be a risk to the commu-\nnity\u201d; and (4) those it determines to be \u201cunlikely to comply\nwith the order of removal.\u201d \u00a71231(a)(6). Individuals re-\nleased after the removal period remain subject to terms of\nsupervision. Ibid.\n  Section 1231(a)(6) does not expressly specify how long de-\ntention past the 90-day removal period may continue for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Court also granted certiorari in a companion case presenting the\n\nsame question.

Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\">533 U. S. 678</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), the Court\nobserved that the statute\u2019s use of the term \u201cmay\u201d introduces\nsome ambiguity and \u201cdoes not necessarily suggest unlim-\nited discretion.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\">Id., at 697</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The Court explained that \u201c[a]\nstatute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would\nraise a serious constitutional problem,\u201d noting that it had\nupheld noncriminal detention as consistent with the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment only under certain\nnarrow circumstances. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\">Id., at 690</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Accordingly, the Court\napplied the canon of constitutional avoidance and deter-\nmined that \u201cread in light of the Constitution\u2019s demands,\u201d\n\u00a71231(a)(6) \u201cdoes not permit indefinite detention\u201d but in-\nstead \u201climits an alien\u2019s post-removal-period detention to a\nperiod reasonably necessary to bring about that alien\u2019s re-\nmoval from the United States.\u201d Id., at 689.\n   Subsequently, in Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___\n(2018), this Court considered the text of other provisions of\nthe INA that authorize detention. One such provision was\n\u00a71226(a), which governs the detention of certain nonciti-\nzens present in the country who were inadmissible at the\ntime of entry or who have been convicted of certain criminal\noffenses since they were admitted. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n4). Section 1226(a) provides that the attorney general\n\u201cmay\u201d detain these noncitizens pending their removal pro-\nceedings and \u201cmay release\u201d such individuals on \u201cbond . . . or\nconditional parole.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71226</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(1), (2). Nonciti-\nzens detained under \u00a71226(a) receive bond hearings after\nthe Government initially detains them. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a7236.1</span><pre class=\"inline\">(d)(1), 1236.1(d)(1) (2021). Relying on Zadvydas,\nthe Ninth Circuit had interpreted \u00a71226(a) to require addi-\ntional, periodic bond hearings every six months, with the\nburden on the Government to prove by clear and convincing\nevidence that further detention was justified. Jennings,\n583 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 22\u201323). The Court in Jen-\nnings disagreed. It held that \u201cthe meaning of the relevant\n\f6             JOHNSON v. ARTEAGA-MARTINEZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatutory provisio[n] is clear\u201d and that it did not support a\nperiodic bond hearing requirement. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n23).\n   The Jennings Court also rejected the lower court\u2019s appli-\ncation of the canon of constitutional avoidance. Earlier in\nits opinion, the Court explained that \u201c[t]he canon of consti-\ntutional avoidance \u2018comes into play only when, after the ap-\nplication of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found\nto be susceptible of more than one construction.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 12) (quoting Clark v. Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137741\"><a href=\"/opinion/137741/clark-v-martinez/\">543 U. S. 371</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n385 (2005)). \u201cIn the absence of more than one plausible con-\nstruction, the canon simply has no application. \u201d Jennings,\n583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Applying this reasoning to \u00a71226(a), the Court\nconcluded that the canon was inapposite because \u201c[n]othing\nin \u00a71226(a)\u2019s text . . . even remotely supports the imposition\nof either of th[e] requirements\u201d the Ninth Circuit had im-\nposed. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 23).\n                              B\n   The question presented is whether \u00a71231(a)(6) requires\nbond hearings before immigration judges after six months\nof detention in which the Government bears the burden of\nproving by clear and convincing evidence that a noncitizen\nposes a flight risk or a danger to the community. Section\n1231(a)(6) provides that certain noncitizens who have been\nordered removed \u201cmay be detained beyond the removal pe-\nriod and, if released, shall be subject to [certain] terms of\nsupervision.\u201d This text, which does not address or \u201ceven\nhin[t]\u201d at the requirements imposed below, directs that we\nanswer this question in the negative. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n14).\n  The Jennings Court emphasized that the canon of consti-\ntutional avoidance is only applicable where a statute has\n\u201cmore than one plausible construction.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12). Here, there is no plausible construction of the text\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Faithfully applying our precedent, the Court can no\nmore discern such requirements from the text of \u00a71231(a)(6)\nthan a periodic bond hearing requirement from the text of\n\u00a71226(a). See id., at ___ (slip op., at 23). Section 1231(a)(6)\ntherefore cannot be read to incorporate the procedures im-\nposed by the courts below as a matter of textual command.\n   Arteaga-Martinez responds that \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s references\nto flight risk, dangerousness, and \u201c \u2018terms of supervision\u2019 \u201d\nsupport the relief ordered below. Brief for Respondent 29\u2013\n30. Similarly, respondents in the companion case analogize\nthe text of \u00a71231(a)(6) to that of \u00a71226(a), and they note that\nnoncitizens detained under \u00a71226(a) have long received\nbond hearings at the outset of detention. Brief for Respond-\nents in Garland v. Gonzalez, O. T. 2021, No. 20\u2013322,\npp. 22\u201324. However, assuming without deciding that an ex-\npress statutory reference to \u201cbond\u201d (as in \u00a71226(a)) might\nbe read to require an initial bond hearing, \u00a71231(a)(6) con-\ntains no such reference. A more oblique reference to terms\nof supervision does not suffice.\n   Respondents in the companion case also emphasize that\nregulations offer custody hearings before immigration\njudges for noncitizens the Government detains under\n\u00a71231(a)(6) because it deems them \u201cspecially dangerous.\u201d\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 CFR \u00a7241.14</span><pre class=\"inline\">; Brief for Respondents in No. 20\u2013322, at\n16, 25\u201326.

Although the Court\nproperly declines to decide Arteaga-Martinez\u2019s due process\nclaim, see ante, at 9, we should revisit whether the Due Pro-\ncess Clause applies at all in this context.\n                              III\n  Third, this case illustrates why we should overrule\nZadvydas at the earliest opportunity. There, the Court held\nthat \u00a71231(a)(6) \u201cwould raise a serious constitutional prob-\nlem\u201d under the Fifth Amendment if it permitted \u201cindefinite\ndetention of an alien.\u201d Id., at 690. To avoid that supposed\n\u201cproblem,\u201d the Court deemed \u201cambiguous\u201d the statutory au-\nthorization that a removable alien \u201cmay be detained beyond\nthe removal period,\u201d and then, clothed in constitutional\ngarb, invoked that manufactured ambiguity to graft a\nmade-up rule onto \u00a71231(a)(6).

The \u201cpresumptively reasonable\u201d detention period, the\nCourt declared, was six months. Id., at 701. The Court of-\nfered no textual support for that (or any) length of time.

Kestutis Zadvydas and\nKim Ho Ma were ordered removed because they had been\nconvicted of serious crimes. Id., at 684\u2013685.

Again,\nthe Government has less reason to detain a person when\nthe alternative is a bail hearing (where the Government has\nan opportunity to show that that person might pose a dan-\nger to the community or a flight risk) than when the alter-\nnative is simply release.\n   The Government argues that a later case, Jennings v.

That later case involved\ndetention under statutes other than the one at issue here\nand in Zadvydas. Jennings, 583 U.

Here is the Court\u2019s answer to that\nquestion in its entirety:\n    \u201cThe Court of Appeals ordered the Government to pro-\n    vide procedural protections that go well beyond the in-\n    itial bond hearing established by existing regulations\u2014\n    namely, periodic bond hearings every six months in\n    which the Attorney General must prove by clear and\n    convincing evidence that the alien\u2019s continued deten-\n    tion is necessary. Nothing in \u00a71226(a)\u2019s text\u2014which\n    says only that the Attorney General \u2018may release\u2019 the\n    alien \u2018on . . . bond\u2019\u2014even remotely supports the impo-\n    sition of either of those requirements. Nor does\n    \u00a71226(a)\u2019s text even hint that the length of detention\n    prior to a bond hearing must specifically be considered\n    in determining whether the alien should be released.\u201d\n    Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 22\u201323) (em-\n    phasis added).\n   The court below did not order periodic bond hearings, but\nit did require the Government to satisfy a \u201cclear and con-\nvincing evidence\u201d standard. Ante, at 3. I agree that Jen-\nnings forecloses this latter requirement. Otherwise, I\nwould find the lower courts\u2019 bail hearing requirements rea-\nsonable implementations of the Zadvydas standard, which\nis applicable here.\n   Since the Court remands this case for further proceed-\nings, I would add that, in my view, Zadvydas applies (the\nCourt does not hold to the contrary), and the parties are free\nto argue about the proper way to implement Zadvydas\u2019\nstandard in this context, and, if necessary, to consider the\nunderlying constitutional question, a matter that this\nCourt has not decided.\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/96405/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1269289/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/142900/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/137741/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/109827/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111290/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6349225/", "id": 6349225, "absolute_url": "/opinion/6477114/kemp-v-united-states/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/6477114/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2022-06-13T08:00:47.429636-07:00", "date_modified": "2022-06-13T08:04:03.540639-07:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "379661b82e746665013a1c8d17e66a01b7ef3a47", "page_count": 17, "download_url": "https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-5726_5iel.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2022/06/13/kemp_v._united_states.pdf", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2021                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 21\u20135726. Argued April 19, 2022\u2014Decided June 13, 2022\nPetitioner Dexter Kemp and seven codefendants were convicted of vari-\n  ous drug and gun crimes. The Eleventh Circuit consolidated their ap-\n  peals and, in November 2013, affirmed their convictions and sen-\n  tences. In April 2015, Kemp moved the District Court to vacate his\n  sentence under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255. The District Court dismissed\n  Kemp\u2019s motion as untimely because it was not filed within one year of\n  \u201cthe date on which [his] judgment of conviction [became] final.\u201d\n  \u00a72255(f)(1). Kemp did not appeal. Then, in June 2018, Kemp sought\n  to reopen his \u00a72255 proceedings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n  60(b), which authorizes a court to reopen a final judgment under cer-\n  tain enumerated circumstances. As relevant here, a party may seek\n  relief within one year under Rule 60(b)(1) based on \u201cmistake, inadvert-\n  ence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d A party may also seek relief\n  \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6) for \u201cany other reason\n  that justifies relief,\u201d but relief under Rule 60(b)(6) is available only\n  when the other grounds for relief specified in Rules 60(b)(1)\u2013(5) are\n  inapplicable. Kemp\u2019s motion to reopen his \u00a72255 proceedings invoked\n  Rule 60(b)(6), but his motion sought reopening based on a \u201cmistake\u201d\n  covered by Rule 60(b)(1). Specifically, Kemp argued that the 1-year\n  limitations period on his \u00a72255 motion did not begin to run until his\n  codefendants\u2019 rehearing petitions were denied in May 2014, making\n  his April 2015 motion timely. The Eleventh Circuit agreed with Kemp\n  that his \u00a72255 motion was timely but concluded that because Kemp\n  alleged judicial mistake, his Rule 60(b) motion fell under Rule 60(b)(1),\n  was subject to Rule 60(c)\u2019s 1-year limitations period, and was therefore\n  untimely.\nHeld: The term \u201cmistake\u201d in Rule 60(b)(1) includes a judge\u2019s errors of\n\f2                       KEMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    law. Because Kemp\u2019s motion alleged such a legal error, it was cogniza-\n    ble under Rule 60(b)(1) and untimely under Rule 60(c)\u2019s 1-year limita-\n    tions period. Pp. 3\u201310.\n       (a) As a matter of text, structure, and history, a \u201cmistake\u201d under\n    Rule 60(b)(1) includes a judge\u2019s errors of law. When the Rule was\n    adopted in 1938 and revised in 1946, the word \u201cmistake\u201d applied to any\n    \u201cmisconception,\u201d \u201cmisunderstanding,\u201d or \u201cfault in opinion or judg-\n    ment.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1383. Likewise, in its\n    legal usage, \u201cmistake\u201d included errors \u201cof law or fact.\u201d Black\u2019s Law\n    Dictionary 1195. Thus, regardless whether \u201cmistake\u201d in Rule 60(b)(1)\n    carries its ordinary meaning or legal meaning, it includes a judge\u2019s\n    mistakes of law. Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s drafters could have used language to\n    connote a narrower understanding of \u201cmistake,\u201d yet they chose not to\n    qualify that term. Similarly, the Rule\u2019s drafters could have excluded\n    mistakes by judges from the Rule\u2019s reach. In fact, the Rule used to\n    read that way. When adopted in 1938, Rule 60(b) initially referred to\n    \u201chis\u201d\u2014i.e., a party\u2019s\u2014\u201cmistake,\u201d so judicial errors were not covered.\n    The 1946 revision to the Rule deleted the word \u201chis,\u201d thereby removing\n    any limitation on whose mistakes could qualify. Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) Neither the Government nor Kemp offers a reason to depart from\n    this reading of Rule 60(b)(1). Pp. 6\u201310.\n         (1) The Government contends that the term \u201cmistake\u201d encom-\n    passes only so-called \u201cobvious\u201d legal errors. This contention\u2014also held\n    by several Courts of Appeals\u2014is unconvincing. None of the dictionar-\n    ies from the time the Rule was adopted and revised suggests this \u201cob-\n    viousness\u201d gloss. Nor does the text or history of Rule 60(b)(1) limit its\n    reach only to flagrant cases that would have historically been corrected\n    by courts sitting in equity. Finally, requiring courts to decide not only\n    whether there was a mistake but also whether that mistake was suffi-\n    ciently \u201cobvious\u201d raises questions of administrability. P. 6.\n         (2) Kemp\u2019s arguments for limiting Rule 60(b)(1) to non-judicial,\n    non-legal errors are also unconvincing. He claims that Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s\n    other grounds for relief\u2014\u201cinadvertence,\u201d \u201csurprise,\u201d and \u201cexcusable\n    neglect\u201d\u2014involve exclusively non-legal, non-judicial errors, and thus\n    \u201cmistake\u201d should be similarly limited. But courts have found that ex-\n    cusable neglect may involve legal error, see, e.g., Lenaghan v.

Kemp argues that Rule 60\u2019s\n    structure favors interpreting the term \u201cmistake\u201d narrowly to include\n    only non-legal errors, and the Court\u2019s contrary interpretation would\n    create confusing overlap between Rule 60(b)(1) and relief available un-\n    der other parts of Rule 60 not subject to Rule 60(c)\u2019s 1-year limitations\n    period. But the overlap Kemp suggests would exist even if \u201cmistake\u201d\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

Courts of Appeals have well-established\n  tests for distinguishing between these Rules. And should such overlap\n  ever create an irreconcilable conflict, courts may then resort to ordi-\n  nary interpretive rules to determine which Rule to apply. As for\n  Kemp\u2019s worry that the Court\u2019s interpretation would allow parties to\n  evade other time limits by, for example, repackaging a tardy motion\n  under Rule 59(e), the risk Kemp identifies would exist even under his\n  own interpretation. And, in any event, the alleged specter of litigation\n  gamesmanship and strategic delay is overstated because a Rule\n  60(b)(1) motion, like all Rule 60(b) motions, must be made \u201cwithin a\n  reasonable time.\u201d Finally, Kemp protests that this Court\u2019s reading is\n  inconsistent with the history of Rule 60(b). But his argument is based\n  on the mistaken notions that Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s list of grounds for reopen-\n  ing was understood to be a \u201cterm of art\u201d when adopted, and that Rule\n  60(b)(6) alone was intended to afford relief for judicial legal errors that\n  had previously been remedied by bills of review.

We conclude,\nbased on the text, structure, and history of Rule 60(b), that\na judge\u2019s errors of law are indeed \u201cmistake[s]\u201d under\nRule 60(b)(1).\n                               I\n   In 2011, a federal jury convicted Dexter Kemp of various\ndrug and gun crimes, and he was sentenced to 420 months\nin prison. Kemp, along with seven codefendants, appealed.\nThe Eleventh Circuit consolidated their appeals and, in No-\nvember 2013, affirmed their convictions and sentences.\nUnited States v. Gray, 544 Fed. Appx. 870. Kemp did not\nseek rehearing of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment or peti-\ntion this Court for certiorari. Two of Kemp\u2019s codefendants\ndid seek rehearing, which the Eleventh Circuit denied in\nMay 2014.\n   In April 2015, Kemp moved the U. S. District Court for\n\f2                  KEMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Southern District of Florida to vacate his sentence un-\nder 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255. The Government objected that\nKemp\u2019s \u00a72255 motion was untimely. As relevant here, such\nmotions must be filed within one year of \u201cthe date on which\nthe judgment of conviction becomes final.\u201d \u00a72255(f )(1). For\nsomeone who, like Kemp, does not petition this Court for\ncertiorari, a judgment becomes final when the time to seek\ncertiorari expires\u2014ordinarily, 90 days after judgment. See\nClay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, 525 (2003); this Court\u2019s\nRule 13.1. In this case, the District Court concluded that\nKemp\u2019s judgment became final in February 2014 (90 days\nafter the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment affirming his convic-\ntion and sentence), making his April 2015 motion over two\nmonths late. The District Court dismissed Kemp\u2019s motion\nin September 2016, and Kemp did not appeal.\n   In June 2018\u2014almost two years later\u2014Kemp attempted\nto reopen his \u00a72255 proceedings under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 60(b), which authorizes a court to reopen a final\njudgment under certain enumerated circumstances. Rule\n60(b)(1) permits a district court to reopen a judgment for\n\u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect,\u201d so\nlong as the motion is filed \u201cwithin a reasonable time,\u201d and,\nat most, one year after the entry of the order under review.\nSee Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 60(b)(1), (c)(1). Meanwhile, Rule\n60(b)(6) permits reopening for \u201cany other reason that justi-\nfies relief,\u201d so long as the motion is filed \u201cwithin a reasona-\nble time.\u201d Rule 60(c)(1).\n   Kemp invoked Rule 60(b)(6), but his motion arguably\nsought reopening based on a kind of \u201cmistake\u201d covered by\nRule 60(b)(1). Specifically, Kemp argued that reopening\nwas warranted because this Court\u2019s Rule 13.3 prescribes\nthat the 90-day clock to seek certiorari does not begin to run\nuntil all parties\u2019 petitions for rehearing are denied, and the\nEleventh Circuit denied his codefendants\u2019 rehearing peti-\ntions in May 2014.

While it agreed with Kemp\nthat his original \u00a72255 motion \u201cappear[ed] to have been\ntimely,\u201d the Eleventh Circuit nonetheless concluded that he\nhad filed his Rule 60(b) motion too late. Id., at 575\u2013576.\nThe Eleventh Circuit held that Kemp\u2019s reopening motion\nalleged \u201cprecisely the sort of judicial mistak[e] in applying\nthe relevant law that Rule 60(b)(1) encompasses,\u201d and thus\nwas subject to Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s 1-year limitations period.

Kemp\u2019s motion,\nthe Government says, alleged an obvious legal error, so the\nEleventh Circuit was correct to apply Rule 60(b)(1). Accord-\ning to Kemp, however, Rule 60(b)(1) applies only to factual\nerrors made by someone other than the judge. Brief for Pe-\ntitioner 3. So, in Kemp\u2019s view, his motion challenging the\nDistrict Court\u2019s timeliness ruling was cognizable under\nRule 60(b)(6), and the 1-year limit did not apply.\n   We ultimately disagree with Kemp and agree with the\nGovernment to a point. As a matter of text, structure, and\nhistory, the Government is correct that a \u201cmistake\u201d under\nRule 60(b)(1) includes a judge\u2019s errors of law. But we see\nno reason to limit Rule 60(b)(1) to \u201cobvious\u201d legal mistakes,\nas the Government proposes. We first explain why\nRule 60(b)(1) covers all mistakes of law made by a judge,\nand then address why the Government\u2019s and Kemp\u2019s con-\ntrary interpretations of \u201cmistake\u201d do not persuade us.\n                             A\n The ordinary meaning of the term \u201cmistake\u201d in\nRule 60(b)(1) includes a judge\u2019s legal errors.

In ordinary usage, then, a\n\u201cmistake\u201d was not limited only to factual \u201cmisconception[s]\u201d\nor \u201cmisunderstanding[s],\u201d or to mistakes by non-judicial ac-\ntors.

Thus, regardless whether\n\u201cmistake\u201d in Rule 60(b)(1) carries its ordinary meaning or\nlegal meaning, it includes a judge\u2019s mistakes of law.\n   Had the drafters of Rule 60(b)(1) intended a narrower\nmeaning, they \u201ceasily could have drafted language to that\neffect.\u201d Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp., 571\nU. S. 161, 169 (2014). The difference between \u201cmistake of\nfact\u201d and \u201cmistake of law\u201d was well known at the time. Both\nlay and legal dictionaries identified them as distinct cate-\ngories. See Funk & Wagnalls 1588; Black\u2019s 1195. Thus,\nRule 60(b)(1)\u2019s drafters had at their disposal readily availa-\nble language that could have connoted a narrower under-\nstanding of \u201cmistake.\u201d Yet they chose to include \u201cmistake\u201d\nunqualified.\n   Similarly, Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s drafters could just as easily\nhave excluded mistakes by judges from the Rule\u2019s ambit. In\nfact, the Rule used to read that way. When adopted in 1938,\nRule 60(b) initially referred to \u201chis\u201d\u2014i.e., a party\u2019s\u2014\u201cmis-\ntake,\u201d so judicial errors were not covered. Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 60(b) (1938). In 1946, however, the Rule\u2019s amenders\ndeleted the word \u201chis,\u201d thereby removing any limitation on\nwhose mistakes could qualify. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n60(b)(1) (1946). Thus, as currently written, \u201cmistake\u201d in\n\f6                      KEMP v.

Their rea-\nsons for doing so are unavailing.\n                                1\n   The Government contends that the term \u201cmistake\u201d en-\ncompasses only so-called \u201cobvious\u201d legal errors. Brief for\nUnited States 11. Several Courts of Appeals agree that\nRule 60(b)(1) may be used to correct only \u201c \u2018obvious errors\u2019\nof law, such as overlooking controlling statutes or case law.\u201d\nIn re Ta Chi Navigation (Panama) Corp. S. A., 728 F. 2d\n699, 703 (CA5 1984). The Government argues that this lim-\nitation \u201chas historical roots\u201d because courts of equity tradi-\ntionally \u201ccould grant relief from legal errors, but only \u2018in the\nmost unquestionable and flagrant cases.\u2019 \u201d Brief for United\nStates 18 (quoting Snell v.

Nor does the Government tie the eq-\nuity practice it invokes to the text or history of Rule 60(b).\nFinally, we question the administrability of a rule that re-\nquires courts to decide not only whether there was a \u201cmis-\ntake\u201d but also whether that mistake was sufficiently \u201cobvi-\nous.\u201d The text does not support\u2014let alone require\u2014that\njudges engage in this sort of complex line-drawing.\n                             2\n    We are similarly unconvinced by Kemp\u2019s arguments for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Here, Kemp alleged that the District Court erred by misapplying con-\n\ntrolling law to record facts.

But courts have\nlong found that excusable neglect may involve legal error.\nSee, e.g., Lenaghan v. Pepsico, Inc., 961 F. 2d 1250, 1254\u2013\n1255 (CA6 1992) (per curiam) (\u201cunderstandable, albeit mis-\ntaken, reading of \u201d a local rule); A. F. Dormeyer Co. v. M.

And they have a similar history of\ngranting relief based on \u201cjudicial inadvertence.\u201d Larson v.\nHeritage Square Assocs., 952 F. 2d 1533, 1536 (CA8 1992)\n(emphasis added); see also, e.g., O\u2019Tell v.

Because the words surrounding \u201cmis-\ntake\u201d in Rule 60(b)(1) do not connote exclusively non-legal\nor non-judicial errors, they do not favor Kemp\u2019s narrower\nreading.\n  Kemp also argues that Rule 60\u2019s structure favors inter-\npreting the term \u201cmistake\u201d narrowly. Our interpretation,\nhe contends, would create confusing overlap between\nRule 60(b)(1) and Rule 60(a), which authorizes a court to\n\u201ccorrect a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from over-\nsight or omission whenever one is found in a judgment, or-\nder, or other part of the record.\u201d We disagree. Because\nRule 60(a) covers a subset of \u201cmistake[s]\u201d\u2014e.g., \u201cclerical\u201d\nones\u2014whereas Rule 60(b)(1) covers \u201cmistake[s]\u201d sim-\npliciter, the overlap Kemp alleges would exist even if \u201cmis-\n\f8                  KEMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntake\u201d reached only factual errors. And the Courts of Ap-\npeals have well-established rules for determining when\nRule 60(a), rather than Rule 60(b), should apply. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Griffin, 782 F. 2d 1393, 1397 (CA7 1986).\n   Kemp alleges that our interpretation of Rule 60(b)(1)\nwould create a similar problem with respect to\nRules 60(b)(4) and (b)(5), which authorize relief from voided\njudgments and judgments that lack legal effect. Specifi-\ncally, Kemp contends that a legal \u201cmistake\u201d could warrant\nrelief under both Rule 60(b)(1) and Rule 60(b)(4) or\nRule (b)(5), and a conflict could then arise given that the\nlatter Rules are not subject to a 1-year time limit. But,\nagain, that could occur even if only factual errors count as\n\u201cmistake[s],\u201d since factual errors, too, may justify relief un-\nder Rules 60(b)(4) and (b)(5). And, regardless, should this\noverlap ever create an irreconcilable conflict, courts may\nthen resort to ordinary rules of statutory construction when\nselecting which provision would govern in a particular case.\nSee, e.g., RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated\nBank, 566 U. S. 639, 645 (2012) (\u201c \u2018the specific governs the\ngeneral\u2019 \u201d).\n   Kemp also worries that our interpretation would allow\nparties to evade other time limits set forth in the Federal\nRules. For instance, Rule 59(e) motions to alter or amend\na judgment must be filed within 28 days, and appeals must\ngenerally be filed within 30 days, see Fed. Rule App. Proc.\n4(a)(1)(a). Kemp suggests that our interpretation would al-\nlow someone to repackage a tardy Rule 59(e) motion as a\ntimely Rule 60(b)(1) motion, or to generate a right to an un-\ntimely appeal by filing a Rule 60(b)(1) motion and appealing\nonce it is denied. We are unpersuaded because, yet again,\nthe risk Kemp identifies would exist even under his own\ninterpretation. For example, Kemp provides no explana-\ntion why, under his interpretation of Rule 60(b), parties\ncould not repackage tardy Rule 59(e) motions based on legal\nerrors as motions under Rule 60(b)(6), or recharacterize\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntardy motions based on factual errors as motions under\nRule 60(b)(1). A denial in either case would then permit the\nlitigant to appeal outside Appellate Rule 4\u2019s 30-day time\nlimit.\n   In any event, the alleged specter of litigation gamesman-\nship and strategic delay is overstated. Rule 60(b)(1) mo-\ntions, like all Rule 60(b) motions, must be made \u201cwithin a\nreasonable time.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(c)(1). And while\nwe have no cause to define the \u201creasonable time\u201d standard\nhere, we note that Courts of Appeals have used it to fore-\nstall abusive litigation by denying Rule 60(b)(1) motions al-\nleging errors that should have been raised sooner (e.g., in a\ntimely appeal). See, e.g., Mendez v. Republic Bank, 725\nF. 3d 651, 660 (CA7 2013).\n   Nor, contrary to Kemp\u2019s protestations, is our interpreta-\ntion inconsistent with the history of Rule 60(b). Kemp\npoints out that Rule 60(b)(1) drew its text from existing\nstate procedural rules. See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7473\n(Deering 1937). And he argues that its list of grounds for\nreopening\u2014\u201c \u2018mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and excusa-\nble neglect\u2019 \u201d\u2014was understood when Rule 60(b) was\nadopted to be a \u201cterm of art\u201d that excluded legal errors.\nBrief for Petitioner 10. But while some States interpreted\ntheir rules this way, see, e.g., Lucas v. North Carolina Mut.\nLife Ins. Co., 184 S. C. 119, 120, 191 S. E. 711, 712 (1937)\n(collecting cases), others, like California, did not, see, e.g.,\nMitchell v. California & O. C. S. S. Co., 156 Cal. 576, 578,\n105 P. 590, 592 (1909). Moreover, at least one leading trea-\ntise from the era maintained, consistent with our view, that\n\u201cmistake\u201d encompassed legal errors. See 3 J. Moore & J.\nFriedman, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a760.05, p. 3280 (1938).\nAlthough statutory language \u201cobviously transplanted from\nanother legal source\u201d will often \u201cbring the old soil with it,\u201d\nTaggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 5)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted), that\n\f10                KEMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprinciple applies only when a term\u2019s meaning was \u201cwell-set-\ntled\u201d before the transplantation, Neder v. United States,\n527 U. S. 1, 22 (1999). Here, it was not.\n   Finally, Kemp invokes Rule 60(b)\u2019s 1946 amendments re-\nplacing \u201cbills of review\u201d and other traditional, postjudgment\nreopening mechanisms with Rules 60(b)(2) through (b)(6).\nSee Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b) (1946). He argues that\nRule 60(b)(6) alone was intended to afford relief for judicial\nlegal errors that had previously been remedied by bills of\nreview, because such errors were not cognizable under\nRule 60(b)\u2019s \u201cmistake\u201d provision or its predecessor state\nrules prior to the 1946 amendments. But, as noted, the pre-\namendment Rule 60(b) covered only a party\u2019s mistakes, see\nsupra, at 5\u20136, and for that reason could not be grounds to\ncorrect a judge\u2019s legal mistake. By eliminating that party-\nspecific qualifier, the 1946 amendments opened Rule\n60(b)(1) to judicial mistakes of law previously remediable\nonly by bills of review.\n                         *    *     *\n   In sum, nothing in the text, structure, or history of\nRule 60(b) persuades us to narrowly interpret the otherwise\nbroad term \u201cmistake\u201d to exclude judicial errors of law. Be-\ncause Kemp\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion alleged such a legal error,\nwe affirm the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment that the motion\nwas cognizable under Rule 60(b)(1), subject to a 1-year lim-\nitations period, and, therefore, untimely.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

I write separately to make two\npoints.\n   First, I join the Court\u2019s opinion with the understanding\nthat nothing in it casts doubt on the availability of Rule\n60(b)(6) to reopen a judgment in extraordinary circum-\nstances, including a change in controlling law. See, e.g.,\nBuck v. Davis, 580 U.

Today\u2019s decision does not purport to\ndisturb these settled precedents.\n   Second, I do not understand the Court\u2019s opinion to break\nany new ground as to Rule 60(c)(1), which requires that all\nRule 60(b) motions be \u201cmade within a reasonable time.\u201d See\n11 C.

The answer matters only under rare\ncircumstances: A losing party fails to appeal or secure relief\nunder Rule 59(e), opting instead to file a Rule 60(b) motion.\nThat motion comes more than a year after judgment but\u2014\npiling contingency on contingency\u2014within what the court\nwould otherwise deem a \u201creasonable time.\u201d Rule 60(c)(1).\nBy petitioner\u2019s own (uncontested) count, his is the first pe-\ntition ever to present today\u2019s question for this Court\u2019s re-\nview. See Pet. for Cert. 24; Brief in Opposition 26. Beyond\neven that, an alternative route exists to resolve the ques-\ntion posed here. Congress has adopted the Rules Enabling\nAct. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2071\u20132077. Under its terms, a com-\nmittee composed of judges and practitioners may recom-\nmend to this Court any warranted clarifications to the Fed-\neral Rules of Civil Procedure.             \u00a7 2073.     Those\nrecommendations generally take effect upon our approval\nand absent congressional objection. \u00a7 2074.\n   Undeterred, the Court takes up and resolves this case an-\nyway. It holds that Rule 60(b)(1), not Rule 60(b)(6), applies.\nIn an unexpected twist, the Court adopts a further position\n\f2                  KEMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nneither party saw fit to advance. Going forward, every ju-\ndicial legal error\u2014not just an inadvertent or obvious \u201cmis-\ntake\u201d\u2014is fodder for collateral attack under Rule 60(b)(1).\nAnd what is the basis for all this? A mysterious 1946\namendment deleting the word \u201c \u2018his.\u2019 \u201d See ante, at 5\u20136.\n   Respectfully, I would have dismissed the writ of certiorari\nas improvidently granted. Not only does this case fail to\nmeet our usual standards for review. See Supreme Court\nRule 10. At bottom, this dispute presents a policy question\nabout the proper balance between finality and error correc-\ntion. Should a district court be able to clean up a legal error\nthrough a collateral proceeding on any reasonable timeline\nwithin a year of judgment? Or do Rule 59(e) and the appel-\nlate process provide the necessary corrective measures in\nordinary cases, with Rule 60(b)(6) as a last, narrow avenue\nto relief? Questions like these are best resolved not through\na doubtful interpretive project focused on a pronoun\ndropped in 1946, but through the rulemaking process.\nThere, policy interests on both sides can be accounted for\nand weighed in light of the \u201ccollective experience of bench\nand bar.\u201d Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.

Argued April 19, 2022\u2014Decided June 13, 2022\nPetitioner Dexter Kemp and seven codefendants were convicted of vari-\n  ous drug and gun crimes. The Eleventh Circuit consolidated their ap-\n  peals and, in November 2013, affirmed their convictions and sen-\n  tences. In April 2015, Kemp moved the District Court to vacate his\n  sentence under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U. S. C. \u00a72255</span><pre class=\"inline\">. The District Court dismissed\n  Kemp\u2019s motion as untimely because it was not filed within one year of\n  \u201cthe date on which [his] judgment of conviction [became] final.\u201d\n  \u00a72255(f)(1). Kemp did not appeal. Then, in June 2018, Kemp sought\n  to reopen his \u00a72255 proceedings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n  60(b), which authorizes a court to reopen a final judgment under cer-\n  tain enumerated circumstances. As relevant here, a party may seek\n  relief within one year under Rule 60(b)(1) based on \u201cmistake, inadvert-\n  ence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d A party may also seek relief\n  \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6) for \u201cany other reason\n  that justifies relief,\u201d but relief under Rule 60(b)(6) is available only\n  when the other grounds for relief specified in Rules 60(b)(1)\u2013(5) are\n  inapplicable. Kemp\u2019s motion to reopen his \u00a72255 proceedings invoked\n  Rule 60(b)(6), but his motion sought reopening based on a \u201cmistake\u201d\n  covered by Rule 60(b)(1). Specifically, Kemp argued that the 1-year\n  limitations period on his \u00a72255 motion did not begin to run until his\n  codefendants\u2019 rehearing petitions were denied in May 2014, making\n  his April 2015 motion timely. The Eleventh Circuit agreed with Kemp\n  that his \u00a72255 motion was timely but concluded that because Kemp\n  alleged judicial mistake, his Rule 60(b) motion fell under Rule 60(b)(1),\n  was subject to Rule 60(c)\u2019s 1-year limitations period, and was therefore\n  untimely.\nHeld: The term \u201cmistake\u201d in Rule 60(b)(1) includes a judge\u2019s errors of\n\f2                       KEMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    law. Because Kemp\u2019s motion alleged such a legal error, it was cogniza-\n    ble under Rule 60(b)(1) and untimely under Rule 60(c)\u2019s 1-year limita-\n    tions period. Pp. 3\u201310.\n       (a) As a matter of text, structure, and history, a \u201cmistake\u201d under\n    Rule 60(b)(1) includes a judge\u2019s errors of law. When the Rule was\n    adopted in 1938 and revised in 1946, the word \u201cmistake\u201d applied to any\n    \u201cmisconception,\u201d \u201cmisunderstanding,\u201d or \u201cfault in opinion or judg-\n    ment.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1383. Likewise, in its\n    legal usage, \u201cmistake\u201d included errors \u201cof law or fact.\u201d Black\u2019s Law\n    Dictionary 1195. Thus, regardless whether \u201cmistake\u201d in Rule 60(b)(1)\n    carries its ordinary meaning or legal meaning, it includes a judge\u2019s\n    mistakes of law. Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s drafters could have used language to\n    connote a narrower understanding of \u201cmistake,\u201d yet they chose not to\n    qualify that term. Similarly, the Rule\u2019s drafters could have excluded\n    mistakes by judges from the Rule\u2019s reach. In fact, the Rule used to\n    read that way. When adopted in 1938, Rule 60(b) initially referred to\n    \u201chis\u201d\u2014i.e., a party\u2019s\u2014\u201cmistake,\u201d so judicial errors were not covered.\n    The 1946 revision to the Rule deleted the word \u201chis,\u201d thereby removing\n    any limitation on whose mistakes could qualify. Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) Neither the Government nor Kemp offers a reason to depart from\n    this reading of Rule 60(b)(1). Pp. 6\u201310.\n         (1) The Government contends that the term \u201cmistake\u201d encom-\n    passes only so-called \u201cobvious\u201d legal errors. This contention\u2014also held\n    by several Courts of Appeals\u2014is unconvincing. None of the dictionar-\n    ies from the time the Rule was adopted and revised suggests this \u201cob-\n    viousness\u201d gloss. Nor does the text or history of Rule 60(b)(1) limit its\n    reach only to flagrant cases that would have historically been corrected\n    by courts sitting in equity. Finally, requiring courts to decide not only\n    whether there was a mistake but also whether that mistake was suffi-\n    ciently \u201cobvious\u201d raises questions of administrability. P. 6.\n         (2) Kemp\u2019s arguments for limiting Rule 60(b)(1) to non-judicial,\n    non-legal errors are also unconvincing. He claims that Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s\n    other grounds for relief\u2014\u201cinadvertence,\u201d \u201csurprise,\u201d and \u201cexcusable\n    neglect\u201d\u2014involve exclusively non-legal, non-judicial errors, and thus\n    \u201cmistake\u201d should be similarly limited. But courts have found that ex-\n    cusable neglect may involve legal error, see, e.g., Lenaghan v. Pepsico,\n    Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">961 F. 2d 1250</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1254\u20131255, and they have a similar history of\n    granting relief based on \u201cjudicial inadvertence,\u201d Larson v. Heritage\n    Square Assocs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">952 F. 2d 1533</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1536. Kemp argues that Rule 60\u2019s\n    structure favors interpreting the term \u201cmistake\u201d narrowly to include\n    only non-legal errors, and the Court\u2019s contrary interpretation would\n    create confusing overlap between Rule 60(b)(1) and relief available un-\n    der other parts of Rule 60 not subject to Rule 60(c)\u2019s 1-year limitations\n    period. But the overlap Kemp suggests would exist even if \u201cmistake\u201d\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                       3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  reached only factual errors. Courts of Appeals have well-established\n  tests for distinguishing between these Rules. And should such overlap\n  ever create an irreconcilable conflict, courts may then resort to ordi-\n  nary interpretive rules to determine which Rule to apply. As for\n  Kemp\u2019s worry that the Court\u2019s interpretation would allow parties to\n  evade other time limits by, for example, repackaging a tardy motion\n  under Rule 59(e), the risk Kemp identifies would exist even under his\n  own interpretation. And, in any event, the alleged specter of litigation\n  gamesmanship and strategic delay is overstated because a Rule\n  60(b)(1) motion, like all Rule 60(b) motions, must be made \u201cwithin a\n  reasonable time.\u201d Finally, Kemp protests that this Court\u2019s reading is\n  inconsistent with the history of Rule 60(b). But his argument is based\n  on the mistaken notions that Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s list of grounds for reopen-\n  ing was understood to be a \u201cterm of art\u201d when adopted, and that Rule\n  60(b)(6) alone was intended to afford relief for judicial legal errors that\n  had previously been remedied by bills of review.

Specifi-\ncally, Kemp contends that a legal \u201cmistake\u201d could warrant\nrelief under both Rule 60(b)(1) and Rule 60(b)(4) or\nRule (b)(5), and a conflict could then arise given that the\nlatter Rules are not subject to a 1-year time limit. But,\nagain, that could occur even if only factual errors count as\n\u201cmistake[s],\u201d since factual errors, too, may justify relief un-\nder Rules 60(b)(4) and (b)(5). And, regardless, should this\noverlap ever create an irreconcilable conflict, courts may\nthen resort to ordinary rules of statutory construction when\nselecting which provision would govern in a particular case.\nSee, e.g., RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v.

For instance, Rule 59(e) motions to alter or amend\na judgment must be filed within 28 days, and appeals must\ngenerally be filed within 30 days, see Fed. Rule App. Proc.\n4(a)(1)(a). Kemp suggests that our interpretation would al-\nlow someone to repackage a tardy Rule 59(e) motion as a\ntimely Rule 60(b)(1) motion, or to generate a right to an un-\ntimely appeal by filing a Rule 60(b)(1) motion and appealing\nonce it is denied. We are unpersuaded because, yet again,\nthe risk Kemp identifies would exist even under his own\ninterpretation. For example, Kemp provides no explana-\ntion why, under his interpretation of Rule 60(b), parties\ncould not repackage tardy Rule 59(e) motions based on legal\nerrors as motions under Rule 60(b)(6), or recharacterize\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

See, e.g., Mendez v. Republic Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">725\nF. 3d 651</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 660 (CA7 2013).\n   Nor, contrary to Kemp\u2019s protestations, is our interpreta-\ntion inconsistent with the history of Rule 60(b). Kemp\npoints out that Rule 60(b)(1) drew its text from existing\nstate procedural rules. See, e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7473</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Deering 1937).

Here, it was not.\n   Finally, Kemp invokes Rule 60(b)\u2019s 1946 amendments re-\nplacing \u201cbills of review\u201d and other traditional, postjudgment\nreopening mechanisms with Rules 60(b)(2) through (b)(6).\nSee Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b) (1946). He argues that\nRule 60(b)(6) alone was intended to afford relief for judicial\nlegal errors that had previously been remedied by bills of\nreview, because such errors were not cognizable under\nRule 60(b)\u2019s \u201cmistake\u201d provision or its predecessor state\nrules prior to the 1946 amendments. But, as noted, the pre-\namendment Rule 60(b) covered only a party\u2019s mistakes, see\nsupra, at 5\u20136, and for that reason could not be grounds to\ncorrect a judge\u2019s legal mistake. By eliminating that party-\nspecific qualifier, the 1946 amendments opened Rule\n60(b)(1) to judicial mistakes of law previously remediable\nonly by bills of review.\n                         *    *     *\n   In sum, nothing in the text, structure, or history of\nRule 60(b) persuades us to narrowly interpret the otherwise\nbroad term \u201cmistake\u201d to exclude judicial errors of law. Be-\ncause Kemp\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion alleged such a legal error,\nwe affirm the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment that the motion\nwas cognizable under Rule 60(b)(1), subject to a 1-year lim-\nitations period, and, therefore, untimely.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

The answer matters only under rare\ncircumstances: A losing party fails to appeal or secure relief\nunder Rule 59(e), opting instead to file a Rule 60(b) motion.\nThat motion comes more than a year after judgment but\u2014\npiling contingency on contingency\u2014within what the court\nwould otherwise deem a \u201creasonable time.\u201d Rule 60(c)(1).\nBy petitioner\u2019s own (uncontested) count, his is the first pe-\ntition ever to present today\u2019s question for this Court\u2019s re-\nview. See Pet. for Cert. 24; Brief in Opposition 26. Beyond\neven that, an alternative route exists to resolve the ques-\ntion posed here. Congress has adopted the Rules Enabling\nAct. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2071</span><pre class=\"inline\">\u20132077. Under its terms, a com-\nmittee composed of judges and practitioners may recom-\nmend to this Court any warranted clarifications to the Fed-\neral Rules of Civil Procedure.             \u00a7 2073.     Those\nrecommendations generally take effect upon our approval\nand absent congressional objection. \u00a7 2074.\n   Undeterred, the Court takes up and resolves this case an-\nyway. It holds that Rule 60(b)(1), not Rule 60(b)(6), applies.\nIn an unexpected twist, the Court adopts a further position\n\f2                  KEMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nneither party saw fit to advance. Going forward, every ju-\ndicial legal error\u2014not just an inadvertent or obvious \u201cmis-\ntake\u201d\u2014is fodder for collateral attack under Rule 60(b)(1).\nAnd what is the basis for all this? A mysterious 1946\namendment deleting the word \u201c \u2018his.\u2019 \u201d See ante, at 5\u20136.\n   Respectfully, I would have dismissed the writ of certiorari\nas improvidently granted. Not only does this case fail to\nmeet our usual standards for review. See Supreme Court\nRule 10. At bottom, this dispute presents a policy question\nabout the proper balance between finality and error correc-\ntion. Should a district court be able to clean up a legal error\nthrough a collateral proceeding on any reasonable timeline\nwithin a year of judgment? Or do Rule 59(e) and the appel-\nlate process provide the necessary corrective measures in\nordinary cases, with Rule 60(b)(6) as a last, narrow avenue\nto relief? Questions like these are best resolved not through\na doubtful interpretive project focused on a pronoun\ndropped in 1946, but through the rulemaking process.\nThere, policy interests on both sides can be accounted for\nand weighed in light of the \u201ccollective experience of bench\nand bar.\u201d Mohawk Industries, Inc. v.

Argued March 23, 2022\u2014Decided June 13, 2022*\nThese consolidated cases involve arbitration proceedings abroad for\n  which a party sought discovery in the United States pursuant to 28\n  U. S. C. \u00a71782(a)\u2014a provision authorizing a district court to order the\n  production of evidence \u201cfor use in a proceeding in a foreign or interna-\n  tional tribunal.\u201d In the first case, Luxshare, Ltd., a Hong Kong-based\n  company, alleges fraud in a sales transaction with ZF Automotive US,\n  Inc., a Michigan-based automotive parts manufacturer and subsidiary\n  of a German corporation. The sales contract signed by the parties pro-\n  vided that all disputes would be resolved by three arbitrators under\n  the Arbitration Rules of the German Institution of Arbitration e.V.\n  (DIS), a private dispute-resolution organization based in Berlin. To\n  prepare for a DIS arbitration against ZF, Luxshare filed an application\n  under \u00a71782 in federal court, seeking information from ZF and its of-\n  ficers. The District Court granted the request, and ZF moved to quash,\n  arguing that the DIS panel was not a \u201cforeign or international tribu-\n  nal\u201d under \u00a71782. The District Court denied ZF\u2019s motion. The Sixth\n  Circuit denied a stay.\n     The second case involves AB bankas SNORAS (Snoras), a failed\n  Lithuanian bank declared insolvent and nationalized by Lithuanian\n  authorities. The Fund for Protection of Investors\u2019 Rights in Foreign\n  States\u2014a Russian corporation assigned the rights of a Russian inves-\n  tor in Snoras\u2014initiated a proceeding against Lithuania under a bilat-\n  eral investment treaty between Lithuania and Russia, claiming that\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 21\u2013518, AlixPartners, LLP, et al. v.

LUXSHARE, LTD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Lithuania expropriated investments. Relevant here, the treaty estab-\n    lishes a procedure for resolving \u201cany dispute between one Contracting\n    Party and [an] investor of the other Contracting Party concerning\u201d in-\n    vestments in the first Contracting Party\u2019s territory, and offers parties\n    four options for dispute resolution. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 21\u2013\n    518, pp. 64a\u201365a. The Fund chose an ad hoc arbitration in accordance\n    with Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on Interna-\n    tional Trade Law, with each party selecting one arbitrator and those\n    two choosing a third. After initiating arbitration, the Fund filed a\n    \u00a71782 application in federal court, seeking information from Simon\n    Freakley, who was appointed as a temporary administrator of Snoras,\n    and AlixPartners, LLP, a New York-based consulting firm where\n    Freakley serves as CEO. AlixPartners resisted discovery, arguing that\n    the ad hoc arbitration panel was not a \u201cforeign or international tribu-\n    nal\u201d under \u00a71782 but instead a private adjudicative body. The District\n    Court rejected that argument and granted the Fund\u2019s discovery re-\n    quest. The Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Only a governmental or intergovernmental adjudicative body con-\n stitutes a \u201cforeign or international tribunal\u201d under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71782,\n and the bodies at issue in these cases do not qualify. Pp. 5\u201317.\n    (a) Section 1782(a) provides that a district court may order discovery\n \u201cfor use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal.\u201d Stand-\n ing alone, the word \u201ctribunal\u201d can be used either as a synonym for\n \u201ccourt,\u201d in which case it carries a distinctively governmental flavor, or\n more broadly to refer to any adjudicatory body. While a prior version\n of \u00a71782 covered \u201cany judicial proceeding\u201d in \u201cany court in a foreign\n country,\u201d \u00a71782 (1958 ed.), Congress later expanded the provision to\n cover proceedings in a \u201cforeign or international tribunal.\u201d That shift\n created \u201c \u2018the possibility of U. S. judicial assistance in connection with\n administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings abroad.\u2019 \u201d Intel Corp. v.\n Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 542 U. S. 241, 258 (alterations omitted).\n But while a \u201ctribunal\u201d thus need not be a formal \u201ccourt,\u201d read in con-\n text\u2014with \u201ctribunal\u201d attached to the modifiers \u201cforeign or interna-\n tional\u201d\u2014\u00a71782\u2019s phrase is best understood to refer to an adjudicative\n body that exercises governmental authority.\n    \u201cForeign tribunal\u201d more naturally refers to a tribunal belonging to a\n foreign nation than to a tribunal that is simply located in a foreign\n nation. And for a tribunal to belong to a foreign nation, the tribunal\n must possess sovereign authority conferred by that nation. This read-\n ing of \u201cforeign tribunal\u201d is reinforced by the statutory defaults for dis-\n covery procedure under \u00a71782, which permit district courts to pre-\n scribe the practice and procedure, \u201cwhich may be in whole or part the\n practice and procedure of the foreign country or the international tri-\n bunal.\u201d \u00a71782(a) (emphasis added). The statute thus presumes that\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\na \u201cforeign tribunal\u201d follows \u201cthe practice and procedure of the foreign\ncountry.\u201d That the default discovery procedures for a \u201cforeign tribu-\nnal\u201d are governmental suggests that the body is governmental too.\n   Similarly, an \u201cinternational tribunal\u201d is best understood as one that\ninvolves or is of two or more nations, meaning that those nations have\nimbued the tribunal with official power to adjudicate disputes. So un-\nderstood, a \u201cforeign tribunal\u201d is a tribunal imbued with governmental\nauthority by one nation, and an \u201cinternational tribunal\u201d is a tribunal\nimbued with governmental authority by multiple nations. Pp. 5\u20139.\n   (b) Section 1782\u2019s focus on governmental and intergovernmental tri-\nbunals is confirmed by both the statute\u2019s history and a comparison to\nthe Federal Arbitration Act. From 1855 until 1964, \u00a71782 and its an-\ntecedents covered assistance only to foreign \u201ccourts.\u201d Congress estab-\nlished the Commission on International Rules of Judicial Procedure,\nsee \u00a7\u00a71\u20132, 72 Stat. 1743, and charged the Commission with improving\nthe process of judicial assistance, specifying that the \u201cassistance and\ncooperation\u201d was \u201cbetween the United States and foreign countries\u201d and\nthat \u201cthe rendering of assistance to foreign courts and quasi-judicial\nagencies\u201d should be improved. Ibid. (emphasis added). In 1964, Con-\ngress adopted the Commission\u2019s proposed legislation, which became\nthe modern version of \u00a71782. Interpreting \u00a71782 to reach only bodies\nexercising governmental authority is consistent with Congress\u2019 charge\nto the Commission. The animating purpose of \u00a71782 is comity: Per-\nmitting federal courts to assist foreign and international governmental\nbodies promotes respect for foreign governments and encourages re-\nciprocal assistance. It is difficult to see how enlisting district courts to\nhelp private bodies adjudicating purely private disputes abroad would\nserve that end.\n   Extending \u00a71782 to include private bodies would also be in signifi-\ncant tension with the FAA, which governs domestic arbitration, be-\ncause \u00a71782 permits much broader discovery than the FAA allows. In-\nterpreting \u00a71782 to reach private arbitration would therefore create a\nnotable mismatch between foreign and domestic arbitration. Pp. 9\u2013\n11.\n   (c) The adjudicative bodies in these cases are not governmental or\nintergovernmental tribunals that fall within \u00a71782. The dispute be-\ntween Luxshare and ZF involves private parties that agreed in a pri-\nvate contract that DIS, a private dispute-resolution organization,\nwould arbitrate any disputes between them. No government is in-\nvolved in creating the DIS panel or prescribing its procedures. Con-\ntrary to Luxshare\u2019s suggestion, a commercial arbitral panel like the\nDIS panel does not qualify as governmental simply because the law of\nthe country in which it would sit (here, Germany) governs some as-\npects of arbitration and courts play a role in enforcing arbitration\n\f4           ZF AUTOMOTIVE US, INC. v. LUXSHARE, LTD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    agreements.\n       The ad hoc arbitration panel at issue in the Fund\u2019s dispute with\n    Lithuania presents a harder question. A sovereign is on one side of\n    the dispute, and the option to arbitrate is contained in an international\n    treaty rather than a private contract. Yet neither Lithuania\u2019s presence\n    nor the treaty\u2019s existence is dispositive, because Russia and Lithuania\n    are free to structure investor-state dispute resolution as they see fit.\n    What matters is whether the two nations intended to confer govern-\n    mental authority on an ad hoc panel formed pursuant to the treaty.\n    See BG Group plc v. Republic of Argentina, 572 U. S. 25, 37. The treaty\n    offers a choice of four forums to resolve disputes. The inclusion of\n    courts as one option for dispute resolution reflects Russia and Lithua-\n    nia\u2019s intent to give investors the choice of bringing their disputes be-\n    fore a pre-existing governmental body. By contrast, the ad hoc arbi-\n    tration panel is not a pre-existing body, but one formed for the purpose\n    of adjudicating investor-state disputes. Nothing in the treaty reflects\n    Russia and Lithuania\u2019s intent that an ad hoc panel exercise govern-\n    mental authority. The ad hoc panel has authority because Lithuania\n    and the Fund consented to the arbitration, not because Russia and\n    Lithuania clothed the panel with governmental authority. Any simi-\n    larities between the ad hoc arbitration panel and other adjudicatory\n    bodies from the past are not dispositive. For purposes of \u00a71782, the\n    inquiry is whether the features of the adjudicatory body and other ev-\n    idence establish the intent of the relevant nations to imbue the body\n    in question with governmental authority.

We discuss each in\nturn.\n                               A\n   The first case involves an allegation of fraud in a business\ndeal gone sour. ZF Automotive US, Inc., a Michigan-based\nautomotive parts manufacturer and subsidiary of a German\ncorporation, sold two business units to Luxshare, Ltd., a\nHong Kong-based company, for almost a billion dollars.\nLuxshare claims that after the deal was done, it discovered\nthat ZF had concealed information about the business\nunits. As a result, Luxshare says, it overpaid by hundreds\nof millions of dollars.\n   In the contract governing the sale, the parties had agreed\nthat all disputes would be \u201cexclusively and finally settled\nby three (3) arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration\nRules of the German Institution of Arbitration e.V. (DIS).\u201d\nApp. in No. 21\u2013401, p. 93. DIS is a private dispute-resolu-\ntion organization based in Berlin. The agreement, which is\ngoverned by German law, provides that arbitration take\nplace in Munich and that the arbitration panel be formed\nby Luxshare and ZF each choosing one arbitrator and those\ntwo arbitrators choosing a third.\n   With an eye toward initiating a DIS arbitration against\nZF, Luxshare filed an ex parte application under \u00a71782 in\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U.

The District\nCourt granted the request, and Luxshare served subpoenas\non ZF and the officers.\n   ZF moved to quash the subpoenas, arguing (among other\nthings) that the DIS panel was not a \u201cforeign or interna-\ntional tribunal\u201d under \u00a71782. As ZF acknowledged, how-\never, Circuit precedent foreclosed that argument. See Ab-\ndul Latif Jameel Transp. Co. v. FedEx Corp., 939 F. 3d 710\n(CA6 2019). The District Court ordered ZF to produce doc-\numents and an officer to sit for a deposition, and the Sixth\nCircuit denied ZF\u2019s request for a stay.\n   We granted a stay and certiorari before judgment to re-\nsolve a split among the Courts of Appeals over whether the\nphrase \u201cforeign or international tribunal\u201d in \u00a71782 includes\nprivate arbitral panels.

The\nDistrict Court rejected that argument and granted the\nFund\u2019s discovery request.\n   The Second Circuit affirmed. Unlike the Sixth Circuit,\nthe Second Circuit had previously held that a private arbi-\ntration panel does not constitute a \u201cforeign or international\ntribunal\u201d under \u00a71782. See National Broadcasting Co., 165\nF. 3d 184. But it still had to decide how to classify the\nad hoc panel that would adjudicate the dispute between the\nFund and Lithuania. After employing a multifactor test to\ndetermine \u201c \u2018whether the body in question possesses the\nfunctional attributes most commonly associated with pri-\nvate arbitration,\u2019 \u201d it concluded that the ad hoc panel was\n\u201cforeign or international\u201d rather than private. 5 F. 4th 216,\n225, 228 (2021).\n   We granted certiorari and consolidated the two cases.\n595 U.

If the former, all agree that \u00a71782 permits discovery\nto proceed in both cases. If the latter, we must determine\nwhether the arbitral panels in these cases qualify as gov-\nernmental or intergovernmental bodies.\n                               A\n  Section 1782(a) provides:\n      \u201cThe district court of the district in which a person\n    resides or is found may order him to give his testimony\n    or statement or to produce a document or other thing\n    for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tri-\n    bunal, including criminal investigations conducted be-\n    fore formal accusation.\u201d\n\f6         ZF AUTOMOTIVE US, INC. v. LUXSHARE, LTD.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nThe key phrase for purposes of this case is \u201cforeign or inter-\nnational tribunal.\u201d\n    Standing alone, the word \u201ctribunal\u201d casts little light on\nthe question. It can be used as a synonym for \u201ccourt,\u201d in\nwhich case it carries a distinctively governmental flavor.\nSee, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1677 (4th ed. rev. 1968)\n(\u201c[t]he seat of a judge\u201d or \u201ca judicial court; the jurisdiction\nwhich the judges exercise\u201d). But it can also be used more\nbroadly to refer to any adjudicatory body. See, e.g., Ameri-\ncan Heritage Dictionary 1369 (1969) (\u201c[a]nything having\nthe power of determining or judging\u201d). Here, statutory his-\ntory indicates that Congress used \u201ctribunal\u201d in the broader\nsense. A prior version of \u00a71782 covered \u201cany judicial pro-\nceeding\u201d in \u201cany court in a foreign country,\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71782 (1958 ed.), but in 1964, Congress expanded the pro-\nvision to cover proceedings in a \u201cforeign or international tri-\nbunal.\u201d As we have previously observed, that shift created\n\u201c \u2018the possibility of U. S. judicial assistance in connection\nwith administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings\nabroad.\u2019 \u201d Intel, 542 U. S., at 258 (alterations omitted). So\na \u00a71782 \u201ctribunal\u201d need not be a formal \u201ccourt,\u201d and the\nbroad meaning of \u201ctribunal\u201d does not itself exclude private\nadjudicatory bodies.1 If we had nothing but this single word\nto go on, there would be a good case for including private\narbitral panels.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Luxshare argues that commercial arbitral panels are \u00a71782 tribunals\n\nbecause they \u201cfit comfortably\u201d under the \u201cquasi-judicial paradigm\u201d from\nour decision in Intel. Brief for Respondent in No. 21\u2013401, p. 19. There,\nwe recognized that the body at issue, the Commission of the European\nCommunities, was a \u00a71782 tribunal in part because it was a \u201cfirst-in-\nstance decisionmaker\u201d that rendered dispositive rulings reviewable in\ncourt. 542 U. S., at 254\u2013255, 258. But we did not purport to establish a\ntest for what counts as a foreign or international tribunal. The issue\nbefore us now\u2014whether a private arbitral body qualifies as a \u201cforeign or\ninternational tribunal\u201d\u2014was not before us in Intel. No one there dis-\nputed that the body at issue exercised governmental authority.\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. 397,\n406 (2011) (\u201c[T]wo words together may assume a more par-\nticular meaning than those words in isolation\u201d).\n   Take \u201cforeign tribunal\u201d first. Congress could have used\n\u201cforeign\u201d in one of two ways here. It could mean something\nlike \u201c[b]elonging to another nation or country,\u201d which would\nsupport reading \u201cforeign tribunal\u201d as a governmental body.\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary, at 775. Or it could more generally\nmean \u201cfrom\u201d another country, which would sweep in private\nadjudicative bodies too. See, e.g., Random House Diction-\nary of the English Language 555 (1966) (\u201cderived from an-\nother country or nation; not native\u201d). The first meaning is\nthe better fit.\n   The word \u201cforeign\u201d takes on its more governmental mean-\ning when modifying a word with potential governmental or\nsovereign connotations. That is why \u201cforeign\u201d suggests\nsomething different in the phrase \u201cforeign leader\u201d than it\ndoes in \u201cforeign films.\u201d Brief for Petitioners in No. 21\u2013401,\npp. 20\u201321; Brief for Respondent in No. 21\u2013401, pp. 7\u20138. The\nphrase \u201cforeign leader\u201d brings to mind \u201can official of a for-\neign state, not a team captain of a European football club.\u201d\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17. So too with\n\u201cforeign tribunal.\u201d \u201cTribunal\u201d is a word with potential gov-\nernmental or sovereign connotations, so \u201cforeign tribunal\u201d\nmore naturally refers to a tribunal belonging to a foreign\nnation than to a tribunal that is simply located in a foreign\nnation. And for a tribunal to belong to a foreign nation, the\ntribunal must possess sovereign authority conferred by that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The parties do not dispute that the bodies at issue are sufficiently\n\nadjudicatory, so we need not precisely define the outer bounds of \u00a71782\n\u201ctribunals.\u201d The issue here is only whether the statute requires \u201ctribu-\nnals\u201d to be governmental or intergovernmental bodies.\n\f8         ZF AUTOMOTIVE US, INC. v. LUXSHARE, LTD.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nnation. See id., at 14\u201315 (a governmental adjudicator is\n\u201cone whose role in deciding the dispute rests on\u201d a \u201cnation\u2019s\nsovereign authority\u201d).\n   This reading of \u201cforeign tribunal\u201d is reinforced by the\nstatutory defaults for discovery procedure. In addition to\nauthorizing district courts to order testimony or the produc-\ntion of evidence, \u00a71782 permits them to \u201cprescribe the prac-\ntice and procedure, which may be in whole or part the prac-\ntice and procedure of the foreign country or the international\ntribunal, for taking the testimony or statement or produc-\ning the document or other thing.\u201d \u00a71782(a) (emphasis\nadded). The reference to the procedure of \u201cthe foreign coun-\ntry or the international tribunal\u201d parallels the authoriza-\ntion for district courts to grant discovery for use in a \u201cfor-\neign or international tribunal\u201d mentioned just before in\n\u00a71782. The statute thus presumes that a \u201cforeign tribunal\u201d\nfollows \u201cthe practice and procedure of the foreign country.\u201d\nIt is unremarkable for the statute to presume that a foreign\ncourt, quasi-judicial body, or any other governmental adju-\ndicatory body follows the practice and procedures pre-\nscribed by the government that conferred authority on it.3\nBut that would be an odd assumption to make about a pri-\nvate adjudicatory body, which is typically the creature of an\nagreement between private parties who prescribe their own\nrules. See Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l Corp.,\n559 U. S. 662, 683 (2010). That the default discovery pro-\ncedures for a \u201cforeign tribunal\u201d are governmental suggests\nthat the body is governmental too.\n   Now for \u201cinternational tribunal.\u201d \u201cInternational\u201d can\nmean either (1) involving or of two or more \u201cnations,\u201d or (2)\ninvolving or of two or more \u201cnationalities.\u201d American Her-\nitage Dictionary, at 685 (\u201c[o]f, relating to, or involving two\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The provision makes the similarly unremarkable assumption that an\n\n\u201cinternational tribunal\u201d defaults to the rules on which the relevant na-\ntions agreed.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

The latter definition is unlikely in\nthis context because an adjudicative body would be \u201cinter-\nnational\u201d if it had adjudicators of different nationalities\u2014\nand it would be strange for the availability of discovery to\nturn on the national origin of the adjudicators. So no party\nargues that \u201cinternational\u201d carries that meaning here. A\ntribunal is \u201cinternational\u201d when it involves or is of two or\nmore nations, meaning that those nations have imbued the\ntribunal with official power to adjudicate disputes. See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 77 (the United States arguing that \u201cthe touch-\nstone\u201d is whether the body is \u201cexercising official power on\nbehalf of the two governments\u201d).\n   So understood, \u201cforeign tribunal\u201d and \u201cinternational tri-\nbunal\u201d complement one another; the former is a tribunal\nimbued with governmental authority by one nation, and the\nlatter is a tribunal imbued with governmental authority by\nmultiple nations.\n                              B\n   Section 1782\u2019s focus on governmental and intergovern-\nmental tribunals is confirmed by both the statute\u2019s history\nand a comparison to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9\nU. S. C. \u00a71 et seq.\n   From the start, the statute has been about respecting for-\neign nations and the governmental and intergovernmental\nbodies they create.

The process of combining these two statu-\ntory lines began when Congress established the Commis-\nsion on International Rules of Judicial Procedure. See Act\nof Sept. 2, 1958, Pub. L. 85\u2013906, \u00a7\u00a71\u20132, 72 Stat. 1743. It\ncharged the Commission with improving the process of ju-\ndicial assistance, specifying that the \u201cassistance and coop-\neration\u201d was \u201cbetween the United States and foreign coun-\ntries\u201d and that \u201cthe rendering of assistance to foreign courts\nand quasi-judicial agencies\u201d should be improved. Ibid. (em-\nphasis added). In 1964, Congress adopted the Commis-\nsion\u2019s proposed legislation, which became the modern ver-\nsion of \u00a71782.\n   Interpreting \u00a71782 to reach only bodies exercising gov-\nernmental authority is consistent with Congress\u2019 charge to\nthe Commission. Seen in light of the statutory history, the\namendment did not signal an expansion from public to pri-\nvate bodies, but rather an expansion of the types of public\nbodies covered. By broadening the range of governmental\nand intergovernmental bodies included in \u00a71782, Congress\nincreased the \u201cassistance and cooperation\u201d rendered by the\nUnited States to those nations.\n   After all, the animating purpose of \u00a71782 is comity: Per-\nmitting federal courts to assist foreign and international\ngovernmental bodies promotes respect for foreign govern-\nments and encourages reciprocal assistance. It is difficult\nto see how enlisting district courts to help private bodies\nwould serve that end. Such a broad reading of \u00a71782 would\nopen district court doors to any interested person seeking\nassistance for proceedings before any private adjudicative\nbody\u2014a category broad enough to include everything from\na commercial arbitration panel to a university\u2019s student dis-\nciplinary tribunal. See Brief for Petitioners in No. 21\u2013401,\nat 19. Why would Congress lend the resources of district\ncourts to aid purely private bodies adjudicating purely pri-\nvate disputes abroad?\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Extending \u00a71782 to include private bodies would also be\nin significant tension with the FAA, which governs domes-\ntic arbitration, because \u00a71782 permits much broader discov-\nery than the FAA allows. Among other differences, the FAA\npermits only the arbitration panel to request discovery, see\n9 U. S. C. \u00a77, while district courts can entertain \u00a71782 re-\nquests from foreign or international tribunals or any \u201cinter-\nested person,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71782(a). In addition, prearbitra-\ntion discovery is off the table under the FAA but broadly\navailable under \u00a71782. See Intel, 542 U. S., at 259 (holding\nthat discovery is available for use in proceedings \u201cwithin\nreasonable contemplation\u201d). Interpreting \u00a71782 to reach\nprivate arbitration would therefore create a notable mis-\nmatch between foreign and domestic arbitration. And as\nthe Seventh Circuit observed, \u201c[i]t\u2019s hard to conjure a ra-\ntionale for giving parties to private foreign arbitrations\nsuch broad access to federal-court discovery assistance in\nthe United States while precluding such discovery assis-\ntance for litigants in domestic arbitrations.\u201d Rolls-Royce,\n975 F. 3d, at 695.\n                         *    *     *\n  In sum, we hold that \u00a71782 requires a \u201cforeign or inter-\nnational tribunal\u201d to be governmental or intergovernmen-\ntal. Thus, a \u201cforeign tribunal\u201d is one that exercises govern-\nmental authority conferred by a single nation, and an\n\u201cinternational tribunal\u201d is one that exercises governmental\nauthority conferred by two or more nations. Private adju-\ndicatory bodies do not fall within \u00a71782.\n                              III\n  That leaves the question whether the adjudicative bodies\nin the cases before us are governmental or intergovernmen-\ntal. They are not.\n                           A\n  Analyzing the status of the arbitral panel involved in\n\f12       ZF AUTOMOTIVE US, INC. v. LUXSHARE, LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nLuxshare\u2019s dispute with ZF is straightforward. Private par-\nties agreed in a private contract that DIS, a private dispute-\nresolution organization, would arbitrate any disputes be-\ntween them. See Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at 682 (\u201c[A]n ar-\nbitrator derives his or her powers from the parties\u2019 agree-\nment to forgo the legal process and submit their disputes to\nprivate dispute resolution\u201d). By default, DIS panels operate\nunder DIS rules, just like panels of any other private arbi-\ntration organization operate under private arbitral rules.\nThe panels are formed by the parties\u2014with each party se-\nlecting one arbitrator and those two arbitrators choosing a\nthird. No government is involved in creating the DIS panel\nor prescribing its procedures. This adjudicative body there-\nfore does not qualify as a governmental body.\n   Luxshare weakly suggests that a commercial arbitral\npanel like the DIS panel qualifies as governmental so long\nas the law of the country in which it would sit (here, Ger-\nmany) governs some aspects of arbitration and courts play\na role in enforcing arbitration agreements. See Brief for\nRespondent in No. 21\u2013401, at 26\u201327; Boeing, 954 F. 3d, at\n213\u2013214. But private entities do not become governmental\nbecause laws govern them and courts enforce their con-\ntracts\u2014that would erase any distinction between private\nand governmental adjudicative bodies. Luxshare\u2019s implau-\nsibly broad definition of a governmental adjudicative body\nis nothing but an attempted end run around \u00a71782\u2019s limit.\n                               B\n   The ad hoc arbitration panel at issue in the Fund\u2019s dis-\npute with Lithuania presents a harder question. A sover-\neign is on one side of the dispute, and the option to arbitrate\nis contained in an international treaty rather than a private\ncontract. These factors, which the Fund emphasizes, offer\nsome support for the argument that the ad hoc panel is in-\ntergovernmental. Yet neither Lithuania\u2019s presence nor the\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntreaty\u2019s existence is dispositive, because Russia and Lithu-\nania are free to structure investor-state dispute resolution\nas they see fit. What matters is the substance of their\nagreement: Did these two nations intend to confer govern-\nmental authority on an ad hoc panel formed pursuant to the\ntreaty? See BG Group plc v. Republic of Argentina, 572\nU. S. 25, 37 (2014) (\u201cAs a general matter, a treaty is a con-\ntract, though between nations,\u201d and \u201c[i]ts interpretation\nnormally is, like a contract\u2019s interpretation, a matter of de-\ntermining the parties\u2019 intent\u201d).\n   The provision regarding ad hoc arbitration appears in Ar-\nticle 10, which permits an investor to choose one of four fo-\nrums to resolve disputes:\n    \u201ca) [a] competent court or court of arbitration of the\n    Contracting Party in which territory the investments\n    are made;\n    \u201cb) the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber\n    of Commerce;\n    \u201cc) the Court of Arbitration of the International Cham-\n    ber of Commerce;\n    \u201cd) an ad hoc arbitration in accordance with Arbitra-\n    tion Rules of the United Nations Commission on Inter-\n    national Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\u201d App. to Pet. for\n    Cert. in No. 21\u2013518, at 64a\u201365a.\nThe options on this menu vary in form. For example, a\n\u201ccompetent court or court of arbitration of the Contracting\nParty\u201d (i.e., the state in which an investor does business) is\nclearly governmental; a court \u201cof \u201d a sovereign belongs to\nthat sovereign. The inclusion of courts on the list reflects\nRussia and Lithuania\u2019s intent to give investors the choice\nof bringing their disputes before a pre-existing governmen-\ntal body.\n   An ad hoc arbitration panel, by contrast, is not a pre-ex-\nisting body, but one formed for the purpose of adjudicating\ninvestor-state disputes. And nothing in the treaty reflects\n\f14        ZF AUTOMOTIVE US, INC. v. LUXSHARE, LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nRussia and Lithuania\u2019s intent that an ad hoc panel exercise\ngovernmental authority. For instance, the treaty does not\nitself create the panel; instead, it simply references the set\nof rules that govern the panel\u2019s formation and procedure if\nan investor chooses that forum. In addition, the ad hoc\npanel \u201cfunctions independently\u201d of and is not affiliated with\neither Lithuania or Russia. 5 F. 4th, at 226. It consists of\nindividuals chosen by the parties and lacking any \u201cofficial\naffiliation with Lithuania, Russia, or any other governmen-\ntal or intergovernmental entity.\u201d Ibid. And it lacks other\npossible indicia of a governmental nature. See ibid. (\u201c[T]he\npanel receives zero government funding,\u201d \u201cthe proceedings\n. . . maintain confidentiality,\u201d and the \u201c \u2018award may be made\npublic only with the consent of both parties\u2019 \u201d).4\n    Indeed, the ad hoc panel at issue in the Fund\u2019s dispute\nwith Lithuania is \u201cmaterially indistinguishable in form and\nfunction\u201d from the DIS panel resolving the dispute between\nZF and Luxshare. Brief for George A. Bermann et al. as\nAmici Curiae 19. In a private arbitration, the panel derives\nits authority from the parties\u2019 consent to arbitrate. The\nad hoc panel in this case derives its authority in essentially\nthe same way. Russia and Lithuania each agreed in the\ntreaty to submit to ad hoc arbitration if an investor chose\nit. The Fund took Lithuania up on that offer by initiating\nsuch an arbitration, thereby triggering the formation of an\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Comparing Article 10 of the treaty (governing investor-state disputes)\n\nwith Article 11 (governing state-to-state disputes) further suggests that\nthe ad hoc panel under Article 10 is of a nongovernmental nature. Arti-\ncle 11 provides that an unsettled dispute between the countries \u201cshall,\nupon the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an Arbitral\nTribunal.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 21\u2013518, p. 65a. Each country is\ninvolved in forming that arbitral body and funds its operations. See id.,\nat 66a\u201367a. Article 11 also provides, under some circumstances, for the\ncountries to invite officials of the International Court of Justice to ap-\npoint the body\u2019s members. Id., at 66a. This reflects a higher level of\ngovernment involvement and highlights the absence of such details in\nArticle 10\u2019s ad hoc arbitration option.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nad hoc panel with the authority to resolve the parties\u2019 dis-\npute. That authority exists because Lithuania and the\nFund consented to the arbitration, not because Russia and\nLithuania clothed the panel with governmental authority.\nCf. Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U. S. 287, 299 (2010)\n(\u201c[T]he first principle that underscores all of our arbitration\ndecisions\u201d is that \u201c[a]rbitration is strictly \u2018a matter of con-\nsent\u2019 \u201d); AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Work-\ners, 475 U. S. 643, 648\u2013649 (1986) (\u201c[A]rbitrators derive\ntheir authority to resolve disputes only because the parties\nhave agreed in advance to submit such grievances to arbi-\ntration\u201d). So inclusion in the treaty does not, as the Fund\nsuggests, automatically render ad hoc arbitration govern-\nmental. Instead, it reflects the countries\u2019 choice to offer in-\nvestors the potentially appealing option of bringing their\ndisputes to a private arbitration panel that operates like\ncommercial arbitration panels do. In a treaty designed to\nattract foreign investors by offering \u201cfavourable conditions\nfor investments,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 21\u2013518, at\n56a, that choice makes sense.\n   None of this forecloses the possibility that sovereigns\nmight imbue an ad hoc arbitration panel with official au-\nthority. Governmental and intergovernmental bodies may\ntake many forms, and we do not attempt to prescribe how\nthey should be structured. The point is only that a body\ndoes not possess governmental authority just because na-\ntions agree in a treaty to submit to arbitration before it.\nThe relevant question is whether the nations intended that\nthe ad hoc panel exercise governmental authority. And\nhere, all indications are that they did not.\n   The Fund tries to bolster its case by analogizing to past\nadjudicatory bodies: (1) the body at issue in the dispute over\nthe sinking of the Canadian ship I\u2019m Alone, which derived\nfrom a treaty between the United States and Great Britain;\nand (2) the United States-Germany Mixed Claims Commis-\nsion. There appears to be broad consensus that these bodies\n\f16       ZF AUTOMOTIVE US, INC. v. LUXSHARE, LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould qualify as intergovernmental. Ergo, the Fund says,\nthe ad hoc panel must be intergovernmental too.\n   This does not follow. It is not dispositive whether an ad-\njudicative body shares some features of other bodies that\nlook governmental. Instead, the inquiry is whether those\nfeatures and other evidence establish the intent of the rele-\nvant nations to imbue the body in question with govern-\nmental authority. And though we need not decide the sta-\ntus of the I\u2019m Alone and Mixed Claims commissions, it is\nworth noting some differences between the treaties provid-\ning for them and the treaty at issue here. For instance,\nthose treaties specified that each sovereign would be in-\nvolved in the formation of the bodies, and, with respect to\nthe treaty creating the Mixed Claims Commission in par-\nticular, it also specified where the commission would ini-\ntially meet, the method of funding, and that the commis-\nsioners could appoint other officers to assist in the\nproceedings. See Convention Between the United States\nand Great Britain for Prevention of Smuggling of Intoxicat-\ning Liquors, Art. IV, Jan. 23, 1924, 43 Stat. 1761\u20131762,\nT. S.

S. No. 665. So\nwhile there are some similarities between the ad hoc arbi-\ntration panel and the I\u2019m Alone and Mixed Claims commis-\nsions, there are distinctions too. Thus, even taking the\nFund\u2019s argument on its own terms, its analogies are less\nhelpful than it hopes.\n                        *    *     *\n  In sum, only a governmental or intergovernmental adju-\ndicative body constitutes a \u201cforeign or international tribu-\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

From 1855 until 1964, \u00a71782 and its an-\ntecedents covered assistance only to foreign \u201ccourts.\u201d Congress estab-\nlished the Commission on International Rules of Judicial Procedure,\nsee \u00a7\u00a71\u20132, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">72 Stat. 1743</span><pre class=\"inline\">, and charged the Commission with improving\nthe process of judicial assistance, specifying that the \u201cassistance and\ncooperation\u201d was \u201cbetween the United States and foreign countries\u201d and\nthat \u201cthe rendering of assistance to foreign courts and quasi-judicial\nagencies\u201d should be improved. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ibid.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (emphasis added). In 1964, Con-\ngress adopted the Commission\u2019s proposed legislation, which became\nthe modern version of \u00a71782. Interpreting \u00a71782 to reach only bodies\nexercising governmental authority is consistent with Congress\u2019 charge\nto the Commission. The animating purpose of \u00a71782 is comity: Per-\nmitting federal courts to assist foreign and international governmental\nbodies promotes respect for foreign governments and encourages re-\nciprocal assistance. It is difficult to see how enlisting district courts to\nhelp private bodies adjudicating purely private disputes abroad would\nserve that end.\n   Extending \u00a71782 to include private bodies would also be in signifi-\ncant tension with the FAA, which governs domestic arbitration, be-\ncause \u00a71782 permits much broader discovery than the FAA allows. In-\nterpreting \u00a71782 to reach private arbitration would therefore create a\nnotable mismatch between foreign and domestic arbitration. Pp. 9\u2013\n11.\n   (c) The adjudicative bodies in these cases are not governmental or\nintergovernmental tribunals that fall within \u00a71782. The dispute be-\ntween Luxshare and ZF involves private parties that agreed in a pri-\nvate contract that DIS, a private dispute-resolution organization,\nwould arbitrate any disputes between them. No government is in-\nvolved in creating the DIS panel or prescribing its procedures. Con-\ntrary to Luxshare\u2019s suggestion, a commercial arbitral panel like the\nDIS panel does not qualify as governmental simply because the law of\nthe country in which it would sit (here, Germany) governs some as-\npects of arbitration and courts play a role in enforcing arbitration\n\f4           ZF AUTOMOTIVE US, INC. v. LUXSHARE, LTD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    agreements.\n       The ad hoc arbitration panel at issue in the Fund\u2019s dispute with\n    Lithuania presents a harder question. A sovereign is on one side of\n    the dispute, and the option to arbitrate is contained in an international\n    treaty rather than a private contract. Yet neither Lithuania\u2019s presence\n    nor the treaty\u2019s existence is dispositive, because Russia and Lithuania\n    are free to structure investor-state dispute resolution as they see fit.\n    What matters is whether the two nations intended to confer govern-\n    mental authority on an ad hoc panel formed pursuant to the treaty.\n    See BG Group plc v. Republic of Argentina, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">572 U. S. 25</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 37. The treaty\n    offers a choice of four forums to resolve disputes. The inclusion of\n    courts as one option for dispute resolution reflects Russia and Lithua-\n    nia\u2019s intent to give investors the choice of bringing their disputes be-\n    fore a pre-existing governmental body. By contrast, the ad hoc arbi-\n    tration panel is not a pre-existing body, but one formed for the purpose\n    of adjudicating investor-state disputes. Nothing in the treaty reflects\n    Russia and Lithuania\u2019s intent that an ad hoc panel exercise govern-\n    mental authority. The ad hoc panel has authority because Lithuania\n    and the Fund consented to the arbitration, not because Russia and\n    Lithuania clothed the panel with governmental authority. Any simi-\n    larities between the ad hoc arbitration panel and other adjudicatory\n    bodies from the past are not dispositive. For purposes of \u00a71782, the\n    inquiry is whether the features of the adjudicatory body and other ev-\n    idence establish the intent of the relevant nations to imbue the body\n    in question with governmental authority.

We discuss each in\nturn.\n                               A\n   The first case involves an allegation of fraud in a business\ndeal gone sour. ZF Automotive US, Inc., a Michigan-based\nautomotive parts manufacturer and subsidiary of a German\ncorporation, sold two business units to Luxshare, Ltd., a\nHong Kong-based company, for almost a billion dollars.\nLuxshare claims that after the deal was done, it discovered\nthat ZF had concealed information about the business\nunits. As a result, Luxshare says, it overpaid by hundreds\nof millions of dollars.\n   In the contract governing the sale, the parties had agreed\nthat all disputes would be \u201cexclusively and finally settled\nby three (3) arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration\nRules of the German Institution of Arbitration e.V.

It can be used as a synonym for \u201ccourt,\u201d in\nwhich case it carries a distinctively governmental flavor.\nSee, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1677 (4th ed. rev. 1968)\n(\u201c[t]he seat of a judge\u201d or \u201ca judicial court; the jurisdiction\nwhich the judges exercise\u201d).

Here, statutory his-\ntory indicates that Congress used \u201ctribunal\u201d in the broader\nsense.

In 1964, Congress adopted the Commis-\nsion\u2019s proposed legislation, which became the modern ver-\nsion of \u00a71782.\n   Interpreting \u00a71782 to reach only bodies exercising gov-\nernmental authority is consistent with Congress\u2019 charge to\nthe Commission. Seen in light of the statutory history, the\namendment did not signal an expansion from public to pri-\nvate bodies, but rather an expansion of the types of public\nbodies covered. By broadening the range of governmental\nand intergovernmental bodies included in \u00a71782, Congress\nincreased the \u201cassistance and cooperation\u201d rendered by the\nUnited States to those nations.\n   After all, the animating purpose of \u00a71782 is comity: Per-\nmitting federal courts to assist foreign and international\ngovernmental bodies promotes respect for foreign govern-\nments and encourages reciprocal assistance. It is difficult\nto see how enlisting district courts to help private bodies\nwould serve that end. Such a broad reading of \u00a71782 would\nopen district court doors to any interested person seeking\nassistance for proceedings before any private adjudicative\nbody\u2014a category broad enough to include everything from\na commercial arbitration panel to a university\u2019s student dis-\nciplinary tribunal.

No government is involved in creating the DIS panel\nor prescribing its procedures. This adjudicative body there-\nfore does not qualify as a governmental body.\n   Luxshare weakly suggests that a commercial arbitral\npanel like the DIS panel qualifies as governmental so long\nas the law of the country in which it would sit (here, Ger-\nmany) governs some aspects of arbitration and courts play\na role in enforcing arbitration agreements. See Brief for\nRespondent in No. 21\u2013401, at 26\u201327; Boeing, 954 F. 3d, at\n213\u2013214.

The inclusion of courts on the list reflects\nRussia and Lithuania\u2019s intent to give investors the choice\nof bringing their disputes before a pre-existing governmen-\ntal body.\n   An ad hoc arbitration panel, by contrast, is not a pre-ex-\nisting body, but one formed for the purpose of adjudicating\ninvestor-state disputes. And nothing in the treaty reflects\n\f14        ZF AUTOMOTIVE US, INC. v.

For instance, the treaty does not\nitself create the panel; instead, it simply references the set\nof rules that govern the panel\u2019s formation and procedure if\nan investor chooses that forum. In addition, the ad hoc\npanel \u201cfunctions independently\u201d of and is not affiliated with\neither Lithuania or Russia. 5 F. 4th, at 226.

Brief for George A. Bermann et al. as\nAmici Curiae 19. In a private arbitration, the panel derives\nits authority from the parties\u2019 consent to arbitrate. The\nad hoc panel in this case derives its authority in essentially\nthe same way. Russia and Lithuania each agreed in the\ntreaty to submit to ad hoc arbitration if an investor chose\nit. The Fund took Lithuania up on that offer by initiating\nsuch an arbitration, thereby triggering the formation of an\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Comparing Article 10 of the treaty (governing investor-state disputes)\n\nwith Article 11 (governing state-to-state disputes) further suggests that\nthe ad hoc panel under Article 10 is of a nongovernmental nature.

Article 11 also provides, under some circumstances, for the\ncountries to invite officials of the International Court of Justice to ap-\npoint the body\u2019s members. Id., at 66a.

Instead, it reflects the countries\u2019 choice to offer in-\nvestors the potentially appealing option of bringing their\ndisputes to a private arbitration panel that operates like\ncommercial arbitration panels do. In a treaty designed to\nattract foreign investors by offering \u201cfavourable conditions\nfor investments,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 21\u2013518, at\n56a, that choice makes sense.\n   None of this forecloses the possibility that sovereigns\nmight imbue an ad hoc arbitration panel with official au-\nthority. Governmental and intergovernmental bodies may\ntake many forms, and we do not attempt to prescribe how\nthey should be structured. The point is only that a body\ndoes not possess governmental authority just because na-\ntions agree in a treaty to submit to arbitration before it.\nThe relevant question is whether the nations intended that\nthe ad hoc panel exercise governmental authority. And\nhere, all indications are that they did not.\n   The Fund tries to bolster its case by analogizing to past\nadjudicatory bodies: (1) the body at issue in the dispute over\nthe sinking of the Canadian ship I\u2019m Alone, which derived\nfrom a treaty between the United States and Great Britain;\nand (2) the United States-Germany Mixed Claims Commis-\nsion.

Ergo, the Fund says,\nthe ad hoc panel must be intergovernmental too.\n   This does not follow. It is not dispositive whether an ad-\njudicative body shares some features of other bodies that\nlook governmental. Instead, the inquiry is whether those\nfeatures and other evidence establish the intent of the rele-\nvant nations to imbue the body in question with govern-\nmental authority. And though we need not decide the sta-\ntus of the I\u2019m Alone and Mixed Claims commissions, it is\nworth noting some differences between the treaties provid-\ning for them and the treaty at issue here. For instance,\nthose treaties specified that each sovereign would be in-\nvolved in the formation of the bodies, and, with respect to\nthe treaty creating the Mixed Claims Commission in par-\nticular, it also specified where the commission would ini-\ntially meet, the method of funding, and that the commis-\nsioners could appoint other officers to assist in the\nproceedings.

Decided June 13, 2022\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE BREYER and\nJUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting from the denial of certio-\nrari.\n   A state habeas court recommended vacating petitioner\nTerence Andrus\u2019 death sentence after an 8-day hearing that\nuncovered a plethora of mitigating evidence that trial coun-\nsel had failed to investigate or present. The court held that\nAndrus had received ineffective assistance of counsel at the\npunishment phase of his trial. See Strickland v. Washing-\nton, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The Court of Criminal Appeals of\nTexas reversed; this Court summarily vacated and re-\nmanded. See Andrus v. Texas, 590 U. S. ___ (2020) (per cu-\nriam).\n   This Court held that counsel had rendered constitution-\nally deficient performance. That conclusion was based on\nan \u201capparent \u2018tidal wave\u2019 \u201d of \u201ccompelling\u201d and \u201cpowerful\nmitigating evidence\u201d in the habeas record, none of which\ncounsel presented to the jury. Id., at ___, ___, ___ (slip op.,\nat 9, 11, 18). The Court also found counsel ineffective for\nseveral specific failures to investigate and rebut the State\u2019s\ncase in aggravation. Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 13\u201316). The\nCourt remanded to allow the Texas court to evaluate in the\nfirst instance whether, in light of the Court\u2019s holding as to\ndeficient performance, Andrus had shown prejudice under\nStrickland.\n   On remand, the Court of Criminal Appeals, in a divided\n5-to-4 decision, failed to follow this Court\u2019s ruling. Instead\n\f2                    ANDRUS v. TEXAS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nof properly weighing the habeas evidence as a whole, the\nTexas court concluded that Andrus failed to establish prej-\nudice (and therefore denied habeas relief ) based on its dis-\nagreement with, and rejection of, the determinations un-\nderlying this Court\u2019s holding that Andrus\u2019 counsel had\nrendered deficient performance. As a result, the dissenting\njudges below explained, the Texas court\u2019s opinion was irrec-\noncilable with this Court\u2019s prior decision and barred by ver-\ntical stare decisis and the law of the case.\n   I agree with the dissenting judges below. Andrus\u2019 case\ncries out for intervention, and it is particularly vital that\nthis Court act when necessary to protect against defiance of\nits precedents. The Court, however, denies certiorari. I\nwould summarily reverse, and I respectfully dissent from\nthe Court\u2019s failure to do so.\n                                I\n                               A\n   This Court\u2019s prior decision outlined the events of Andrus\u2019\ntrial and habeas proceedings. See Andrus, 590 U. S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 2\u20137). Only a brief summary follows.\n   In 2008, at age 20, Andrus killed Avelino Diaz and a by-\nstander, Kim-Phuong Vu Bui, during an unsuccessful car-\njacking while under the influence of PCP-laced marijuana.\nThe State charged Andrus with capital murder. At the guilt\nphase of trial, Andrus\u2019 counsel did not put on a defense case\nand informed the jury, in closing, that \u201cthe punishment\nphase\u201d was \u201cwhere we are going to be fighting.\u201d 45 Tr. 18.\n   But defense counsel hardly put up a fight at the punish-\nment phase. Counsel made no opening statement and al-\nlowed the State to put on its case in aggravation essentially\nwithout challenge. After the State rested, the jury heard a\nmere shadow of a case in mitigation. See Andrus, 590 U. S.,\nat ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 3\u20134). Andrus\u2019 counsel presented only\na handful of witnesses, none of whom testified to the ex-\ntreme neglect, privations, and trauma of Andrus\u2019 youth or\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U.

One of the wit-\nnesses, Andrus\u2019 mother, directly contradicted Andrus\u2019 own\ntestimony as to his childhood, testimony that was thor-\noughly corroborated in subsequent habeas proceedings.\nCounsel thus enabled the State to argue credibly in closing\nthat there was no piece of evidence before the jury \u201cthat re-\nduce[d]\u201d Andrus\u2019 \u201cmoral blameworthiness.\u201d 52 Tr. 49.\n\u201c[N]ot one.\u201d Ibid. On this incomplete and corrupted presen-\ntation, the jury sentenced Andrus to death.\n   After the state appellate courts affirmed Andrus\u2019 convic-\ntion and sentence, he filed a state habeas application, now\nrepresented by competent counsel. Andrus alleged in the\nmain that trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to\ninvestigate or present available evidence at the penalty\nphase. Over the course of an 8-day evidentiary hearing, An-\ndrus presented a \u201ctidal wave of information . . . with regard\nto mitigation\u201d that the jury never heard. 7 Habeas Tr. 101.\nBased on this abundance of new evidence, see Andrus, 590\nU. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20137), the state habeas court\ngranted relief and ordered a new punishment trial.\n   The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas reversed. In a\nunanimous order, it concluded that Andrus had \u201cfail[ed] to\nmeet his burden under Strickland.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n29. The court \u201cdecline[d] to adopt any of the trial court\u2019s\nfindings of fact and conclusion of law\u201d and denied relief\nbased on \u201c[its] own review of the record.\u201d Ibid.\n                             B\n  Andrus petitioned for this Court\u2019s review. The Court\ngranted certiorari, summarily vacated the decision below,\nand remanded for further proceedings. See Andrus, 590\nU. S., at ___. The Court held, after a review of the record\nfrom the trial and habeas proceedings, that Andrus had met\nhis burden of establishing constitutionally deficient perfor-\nmance by counsel under the first prong of Strickland.\n  This Court identified three categories in which counsel\u2019s\n\f4                     ANDRUS v. TEXAS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nperformance had fallen short. First, the Court held counsel\nineffective for \u201cperform[ing] almost no mitigation investiga-\ntion, overlooking vast tranches of mitigating evidence\u201d (in-\ncluding evidence of Andrus\u2019 disturbing childhood, the\ntrauma he experienced in juvenile detention, and his life-\nlong mental-health struggles) that would have been \u201ccom-\npelling\u201d and \u201cpowerful.\u201d Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip\nop., at 9, 11). Second, the Court reasoned, counsel\u2019s mysti-\nfying introduction of \u201cseemingly aggravating evidence,\u201d\nsuch as testimony from Andrus\u2019 mother that downplayed\nthe horrors of his childhood and contradicted Andrus\u2019 own\ntestimony, confirmed the \u201cgaping distance\u201d between his\nperformance at trial and the constitutional minimum. Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 12). Third, the Court concluded that\ncounsel had failed to investigate the State\u2019s case in aggra-\nvation and thus did not rebut critical aggravating evidence.\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n   Having found deficient performance, the Court remanded\nfor a determination of prejudice under the second prong of\nStrickland. \u201c[P]rejudice exists,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cif\nthere is a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel\u2019s\nineffectiveness, the jury would have made a different judg-\nment about whether Andrus deserved the death penalty as\nopposed to a lesser sentence.\u201d Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 16). The Court cautioned that the Court of Criminal\nAppeals \u201cmust consider \u2018the totality of the available mitiga-\ntion evidence\u2014both that adduced at trial, and the evidence\nadduced in the habeas proceeding\u2019\u2014and \u2018reweig[h] it\nagainst the evidence in aggravation.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Wil-\nliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 397\u2013398 (2000); alteration in\noriginal). Because Texas law requires a unanimous jury\nrecommendation to impose death, \u201cprejudice here requires\nonly \u2018a reasonable probability that at least one juror would\nhave struck a different balance\u2019 regarding Andrus\u2019 \u2018moral\nculpability.\u2019 \u201d Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17)\n(quoting Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 537\u2013538 (2003);\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U.

Ex parte\nAndrus, 622 S. W. 3d 892 (2021).\n   In summarizing this Court\u2019s opinion vacating and re-\nmanding, the majority of the Texas court four times de-\nscribed this Court\u2019s conclusions as what the Court \u201cbe-\nlieved.\u201d Id., at 896\u2013897. Twice more, the majority caveated\nthis Court\u2019s determinations with \u201c[a]ccording to the Court.\u201d\nIbid. Most strikingly, the majority described what it called\n\u201ccertain alleged failures by counsel\u201d from this Court\u2019s opin-\nion, which had directly held that these failures constituted\ndeficient performance under Strickland prong one. 622\nS. W. 3d, at 897 (emphasis added); see Andrus, 590 U. S.,\nat ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8\u201316).\n   The majority proceeded to find no prejudice under Strick-\nland prong two \u201cbecause the mitigating evidence offered at\nthe habeas stage was relatively weak . . . and because the\naggravating evidence was strong.\u201d 622 S. W. 3d, at 899\u2013\n900. The majority based its decision almost entirely on its\ndisagreement with the conclusions underlying this Court\u2019s\nholding as to Strickland prong one. See, e.g., 622 S. W. 3d,\nat 901 (\u201cAlthough the Supreme Court described Applicant\u2019s\ninfractions [while in juvenile detention] as \u2018notably mild,\u2019\nwe conclude that a jury would have been convinced other-\nwise\u201d); id., at 902 (\u201cThe Supreme Court discounted [Andrus\u2019\nprior] crimes, but we do not\u201d); id., at 903\u2013904 (\u201c[T]he Su-\npreme Court . . . criticized\u201d a photo array, but \u201cwe do not\njudge [it] to be unduly suggestive\u201d). It accordingly dis-\nmissed the mitigating evidence this Court had found \u201ccom-\npelling\u201d and \u201cpowerful,\u201d Andrus, 590 U.

TEXAS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  Judge Newell dissented, joined by three of his colleagues.\nAll four had joined their court\u2019s prior decision denying relief\nand expressed the belief that this Court\u2019s decision to vacate\nand remand was mistaken. Id., at 908. Even so, the dissent\nopined, this Court\u2019s \u201ccharacterization of the mitigation evi-\ndence that [Andrus\u2019] trial attorney failed to uncover was in-\ntegral to the determination that [Andrus\u2019] attorney\u2019s repre-\nsentation fell below prevailing professional norms.\u201d Id., at\n909. In the dissent\u2019s view, the majority was not free to de-\npart from this Court\u2019s conclusions. Ibid.\n  The dissent also criticized the majority for misapplying\nthe applicable prejudice standard. All Andrus had to show\nwas \u201ca reasonable probability that at least one juror would\nhave struck a different balance . . . and voted to spare [An-\ndrus\u2019] life.\u201d Ibid. \u201cBased upon the Supreme Court\u2019s char-\nacterization of the mitigation evidence in this case, [An-\ndrus] has met that standard.\u201d Ibid.\n  Andrus now asks this Court to summarily reverse, Pet.\nfor Cert. 40, supported by eight amicus curiae briefs. The\nCourt, however, denies certiorari.\n                                II\n   This Court previously held that Andrus received consti-\ntutionally deficient assistance of counsel. Andrus contends\nthat he has shown that those deficiencies prejudiced him.\nSee Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. As noted, prejudice exists\nif there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s\nerrors, a single juror \u201c \u2018would have struck a different bal-\nance\u2019 regarding Andrus\u2019 \u2018moral culpability.\u2019 \u201d Andrus, 590\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17) (quoting Wiggins, 539 U. S., at\n537\u2013538). A court must evaluate \u201cthe totality of the avail-\nable mitigation evidence . . . in reweighing it against the ev-\nidence in aggravation.\u201d Williams, 529 U. S., at 397\u2013398.\n   Instead of weighing the totality of the evidence in a man-\nner consistent with this Court\u2019s decision, the Court of Crim-\ninal Appeals violated vertical stare decisis and the law-of-\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

It did not acknowledge powerful record evidence\nthat contradicted its reasoning, and when it did grapple\nwith the evidence this Court previously analyzed, it fol-\nlowed the views of the dissent from the Court\u2019s decision and\nnot the holdings of this Court. As a result, it \u201ceither did not\nconsider or unreasonably discounted\u201d the evidence adduced\nin the habeas proceeding. Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. 30,\n42 (2009) (per curiam). Applying the proper standard, An-\ndrus is plainly entitled to relief, and the Texas court\u2019s con-\ntrary determination should be summarily reversed.\n                              A\n  The Court of Criminal Appeals unmistakably erred in its\nanalysis of prejudice as to both unpresented mitigating ev-\nidence and unexplored evidence rebutting the State\u2019s case\nin aggravation.\n                               1\n   Throughout its opinion, the Texas court rejected or ig-\nnored this Court\u2019s conclusions as to the childhood mitiga-\ntion and mental-health mitigation evidence adduced on ha-\nbeas review. To the minimal extent that the Texas court\u2019s\nanalysis of the mitigating evidence relied on any evidence\nthis Court did not consider, that reliance does not with-\nstand the slightest scrutiny. The following analysis high-\nlights only a small fraction of the volumes of mitigating ev-\nidence in the habeas record.\n   Mitigating evidence\u2014childhood. This Court previously\nheld that Andrus\u2019 counsel performed deficiently in large\npart because counsel failed to \u201clook into or present the myr-\niad tragic circumstances that marked [his] life.\u201d Andrus,\n590 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). As the Court outlined,\n\u201c[t]he [habeas] evidence revealed a childhood marked by ex-\ntreme neglect and privation.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).\nThat evidence included affidavits, testimony, or both from\n\f8                     ANDRUS v. TEXAS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntwo of Andrus\u2019 siblings, numerous other family friends and\nrelatives, and two expert psychologists who investigated or\nevaluated Andrus\u2019 family circumstances, as well as many\nvolumes of family medical and criminal records.\n   The habeas evidence showed that Andrus and his siblings\nwere raised by a mother who engaged in prostitution, sold\ndrugs, and habitually used drugs in front of the children.\nIbid. She exposed the children to physical and sexual abuse\nthrough her violent boyfriends, one of whom raped Andrus\u2019\nyounger half-sister when she was a child. Ibid.; see also id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 10) (\u201cAndrus suffered \u2018very pronounced\ntrauma\u2019 and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms from,\namong other things, \u2018severe neglect\u2019 and exposure to domes-\ntic violence, substance abuse, and death in his childhood\u201d).\nBeyond the evidence this Court specifically cited, expert ha-\nbeas testimony established that \u201c[w]itnessing domestic vio-\nlence\u201d was \u201ctraumatic\u201d for Andrus, and that even if Andrus\nwas not sexually abused himself, the consequences of the\nrape of his younger half-sister (notably, her removal from\nthe family home) were emotionally disruptive for him, too.\n6 Habeas Tr. 169, 218. There was also evidence that An-\ndrus himself suffered physical abuse: His mother would\nbeat him and his siblings with a board \u201cuntil she got tired\u201d\nand would enlist boyfriends to \u201chold the children down\nwhile she beat them\u201d or beat them directly. 7 id., at 127.\nMoreover, because Andrus\u2019 mother was so often absent or\ndisoriented, she left her children to fend for themselves for\nextended periods, often without leaving them enough food\nto eat. Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). Lacking a\nstable parental figure, Andrus assumed responsibility for\nhis four siblings at around 12 years old: He would cook\nbreakfast for them, get them ready for school, clean for\nthem, help them with their homework, make them dinner,\nand put them to bed. Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20136).\n   The jury heard virtually none of this evidence; counsel\npresented only scattered snippets of testimony that Andrus\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                     9\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwas a good sibling and that his father was incarcerated for\nmuch of his childhood. Thus, the Court explained, counsel\n\u201coverlook[ed] vast tranches\u201d of \u201ccompelling\u201d and \u201cpowerful\u201d\nmitigating evidence. Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 9, 11).1\n  This Court additionally held that counsel rendered defi-\ncient performance because he not only failed to put forward\nthe mitigating evidence referred to above but also unwit-\ntingly aided the State\u2019s case in aggravation. The Court\nnoted that counsel elicited testimony from Andrus\u2019 mother\nthat \u201cdid not reveal any difficult circumstances in Andrus\u2019\nchildhood\u201d but falsely \u201csketched a portrait of a tranquil up-\nbringing, during which Andrus got himself into trouble de-\nspite his family\u2019s best efforts.\u201d Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 3,\n12). This portrait directly \u201cundermined Andrus\u2019 own testi-\nmony.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13). In fact, when Andrus\ntestified that his mother sold drugs from their home, his\ncounsel pointed out that she had said nothing to that end in\nher testimony.       As this Court previously observed,\n\u201c[w]hether counsel merely intended to provide Andrus an\nopportunity to explain the discrepancy (or, far worse,\nsought to signal that his client was being deceitful) the jury\ncould have understood counsel\u2019s statements to insinuate\nthat Andrus was lying,\u201d a suggestion counsel \u201cdid nothing\nto dislodge.\u201d Ibid.\n  On remand, the Court of Criminal Appeals found that An-\ndrus failed to establish prejudice in part because the evi-\ndence of his horrific childhood \u201coverlapped [with] evidence\nheard by the jury,\u201d save for some that was \u201cnot particularly\ncompelling\u201d and \u201crelatively weak.\u201d 622 S. W. 3d, at 893,\n900. In particular, the Texas court expressed doubt as to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Expert evidence on habeas review explained that Andrus\u2019 adverse\n\nchildhood experiences caused \u201csignificant limitations in his childhood\nand adolescent development\u201d that likely \u201cformed the foundation for [his]\nnegative life trajectory,\u201d including his \u201csubstance abuse, maladaptive be-\nhaviors, and ultimate resort to criminal violence.\u201d 13 Habeas Tr., Def.\nExh. 5, p. 2; accord, 6 id., at 152, 167\u2013168.\n\f10                        ANDRUS v. TEXAS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwhether Andrus had suffered physical or sexual abuse, re-\nlying in part on a 2005 report stating that he denied physi-\ncal abuse while in juvenile detention with the Texas Youth\nCommission (TYC). Id., at 900. That directly ignored this\nCourt\u2019s conclusion as to the devastating effects, and corre-\nsponding mitigating value, of exposure to such abuse. In\naddition, by relying on the 2005 TYC report to discount the\npossibility that Andrus suffered physical abuse, the court\nnot only overlooked the habeas evidence of the details of his\nbeatings but also neglected to address expert testimony es-\ntablishing that it was \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cexpected\u201d for juvenile\ndetainees to \u201cdeny having problems\u201d in their homes so as to\navoid displaying weakness. 7 Habeas Tr. 32.2\n   As to the purported overlap, the Court of Criminal Ap-\npeals stressed that some \u201cevidence about family dysfunc-\ntion\u201d was presented to the jury. 622 S. W. 3d, at 900. It\nobserved that Andrus\u2019 mother testified that Andrus was\nhelpful in raising the children, Andrus\u2019 father testified that\nhe had been largely absent, and Andrus testified about his\nmother\u2019s drug dealing and periodic abandonment, indicat-\ning that the evidence uncovered in state habeas proceedings\nwas redundant of that evidence. Ibid. But the court did not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Court of Criminal Appeals also minimized the mitigating impact\n\nof Andrus\u2019 traumatic childhood because, while habeas evidence indicated\nthat he was left hungry, he reportedly once told a \u201cDr. Brown\u201d that he\nnever went without food and did not testify to hunger at trial. 622 S. W.\n3d, at 900\u2013901. Here and elsewhere, the Texas court relied on represen-\ntations in a letter from \u201cDr. Brown,\u201d a psychologist contacted at the last\nminute by deficient trial counsel and who received \u201climited life history\ndocuments.\u201d 13 Habeas Tr., Def. Exh. 2, p. 1. A testifying expert on ha-\nbeas review (who not only met with Andrus repeatedly but also reviewed\nvolumes of records and thoroughly investigated his background, and\nwhose testimony the state habeas court found credible) undercut Dr.\nBrown\u2019s letter as poorly reasoned and unsubstantiated. See 6 id., at 127\u2013\n128, 130; 7 id., at 63\u201368, 150\u2013151; 1 Supp. Clerk\u2019s Record 15. The Texas\ncourt made no mention of this credible expert testimony, and more\nbroadly, it overlooked (as to the issue of hunger) that both Dr. Brown\u2019s\nletter and Andrus\u2019 trial testimony were shaped by ineffective counsel.\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

Nor did\nit consider how Andrus\u2019 counsel\u2019s presentation and com-\nments undercut Andrus\u2019 testimony and aided the State.\nSee supra, at 9.\n   Mitigating evidence\u2014mental health. This Court also\nfound deficient performance in counsel\u2019s failure to investi-\ngate or present evidence of Andrus\u2019 mental health. See id.,\nat ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 10\u201311). The Court noted that even\n\u201c[w]hile attempting to care for his siblings,\u201d Andrus \u201cstrug-\ngled with mental-health issues.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6).\nExpert habeas evidence established that \u201cthe trauma of be-\ning in charge of [his] siblings and not having a parent there\u201d\ncontributed to Andrus\u2019 mental-health issues, deprived him\nof the ability to \u201ctrust anybody,\u201d and meant that he did not\nhave his \u201cown emotional needs met.\u201d 6 Habeas Tr. 168, 183.\n   This Court further observed how these issues worsened\nwhen a teenage Andrus spent 18 months in juvenile deten-\ntion where he was \u201cdosed on high quantities of psychotropic\ndrugs\u201d and \u201cfrequently relegated to extended stints of soli-\ntary confinement,\u201d leaving \u201can already traumatized Andrus\nall but suicidal.\u201d Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).\nThe Court described Andrus\u2019 forcible medication as part of\na traumatizing \u201cordeal,\u201d ibid., again backed by compelling\nevidence from the habeas proceeding.3 In addition, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Habeas evidence established that TYC officials improperly prescribed\n\nAndrus medications that could cause mania, aggression, and psychosis,\namong other adverse effects, and shifted him on and off these medica-\ntions frequently. See 6 Habeas Tr. 160\u2013165; 13 id., Def. Exh. 1, at 3, 5;\nid., Def. Exh. 4, at 6\u20137. Even as officials diagnosed Andrus with mental\nillnesses and subjected him to this rotating set of clinically inappropriate\nmedications, they never provided him with the interventions he needed.\nSee id., at 8\u20139. Instead, they subjected him to a punitive \u201cresocialization\nprogram\u201d that was later discontinued and discredited, see id., at 5\u20136, 9,\nand when he did not succeed, transferred him to adult prison, see, e.g., 5\n\f12                        ANDRUS v. TEXAS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nCourt set forth the harm Andrus\u2019 solitary confinement in\nTYC custody imposed, levied \u201cfor purported infractions like\nreporting that he had heard voices telling him to do bad\nthings.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6); see also id., at ___, n. 2\n(slip op., at 14, n. 2) (citing habeas evidence that Andrus\nwas isolated \u201cfor 90 days at a time when [he] was 16 or 17\nyears old,\u201d which \u201c \u2018would horrify most current profession-\nals\u2019 \u201d).4 Andrus also engaged in self-harm and threats of su-\nicide in TYC custody, this Court noted, acts that culminated\na few years later when, detained pending trial for his capi-\ntal offense, he slashed his wrist and smeared bloody mes-\nsages on the walls asking to \u201c \u2018[j]ust let [him] die.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 6\u20137).\n   In reasoning that Andrus had not established prejudice,\nthe Court of Criminal Appeals stated that the evidence of\nmental-health issues \u201cdeserve[d] some skepticism.\u201d 622\nS. W. 3d, at 901. It discounted Andrus\u2019 mental-health chal-\nlenges because they \u201cwere not so severe or persistent as to\nkeep him from . . . taking care of his siblings,\u201d ibid., without\naccounting for record evidence of how Andrus\u2019 care for his\nsiblings was consistent with, and exacerbated, those chal-\nlenges. It criticized Andrus for \u201con the one hand . . . now\nclaim[ing] he had mental health issues, but on the other . . .\ndecr[ying] having been treated for them\u201d with psychotropic\nmedications while in TYC custody, ibid., contravening this\nCourt\u2019s conclusion as to the damage Andrus suffered from\nbeing forced to take clinically inappropriate medications.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nid., at 121\u2013122 (TYC ombudsman: Andrus \u201cwas [unfairly] held account-\nable for failing in a failed system\u201d).\n   4 The TYC ombudsman, appointed after mounting complaints and pub-\n\nlic scandals, condemned the agency\u2019s use of isolation and explained that\nit involved being locked in a small, dark, and windowless cell with a mat-\ntress. 5 id., at 112, 122, 154\u2013155; 13 id., Def. Exh. 4, at 2\u20134. According\nto the ombudsman\u2019s expert testimony, TYC records showed Andrus was\n\u201cdecomposing\u201d and \u201cbecoming unhinged\u201d as a result of his repeated and\nprolonged isolation \u201cin a dark, damp room with no communication, [no]\nschool.\u201d 5 id., at 170.\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

See n. 2, supra. But even\nif the court had been right to view Andrus\u2019 mental health\nas a double-edged sword, that would not be dispositive. The\nissue is whether the available mitigating evidence, whether\nsusceptible to multiple interpretations or not, \u201cmight have\nsufficiently influenced the jury\u2019s appraisal of Andrus\u2019 moral\nculpability.\u201d Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (in-\nternal quotation marks and alteration omitted). For that to\nbe true, the evidence need not have made Andrus \u201cany more\nlikable to the jury,\u201d so long as it \u201chelped the jury understand\n[him], and his horrendous acts.\u201d Sears v. Upton, 561 U. S.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 To the extent the Texas court cited any evidence in its mental-health\n\nmitigation discussion that this Court did not expressly mention, it gave\nsignificant weight to two written observations by individual TYC ana-\nlysts regarding Andrus\u2019 mental health, pulled from about 1,000 pages of\nTYC records. See 622 S. W. 3d, at 901. But a testifying expert on habeas\nreview, found credible by the state habeas court, testified that the TYC\nanalysts\u2019 views were inconsistent, unreliable, and potentially pretextual,\nsee 7 Habeas Tr. 78\u201380, 85; 1 Supp. Clerk\u2019s Record 15, and still other\nexpert testimony (again, found credible) showed that TYC\u2019s mental-\nhealth program at the time lacked adequate oversight, staffing, and qual-\nity assurance, see 5 Habeas Tr. 161\u2013162; 13 id., Def. Exh. 4, at 6; 1 Supp.\nClerk\u2019s Record 13. The Texas court did not so much as mention this con-\ntrary evidence.\n\f14                     ANDRUS v. TEXAS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n945, 951 (2010) (per curiam).\n   The Court of Criminal Appeals improperly failed to con-\nsider or analyze any of Andrus\u2019 mitigating evidence beyond\nits rejection of this Court\u2019s conclusions. See Williams, 529\nU. S., at 397\u2013398 (finding State Supreme Court decision not\njust erroneous but unreasonable \u201cinsofar as it failed to eval-\nuate the totality of the available mitigation evidence\u201d).\n                              2\n   Aggravating evidence. The Court of Criminal Appeals\nwas even more explicit in rejecting this Court\u2019s conclusions\nregarding counsel\u2019s failure to rebut the State\u2019s aggravating\nevidence.\n   At the penalty phase, the State bore the burden of prov-\ning that Andrus presented a future danger to society. See\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071, \u00a72(b)(1). To that\nend, it put forth evidence that Andrus had been hostile and\nviolent in TYC custody; that he had committed an un-\ncharged aggravated robbery of a dry-cleaning business; that\nhe had been involved in an aggravated robbery as a teen-\nager, for which he was sent to TYC detention; that he had\nalso been adjudicated as a juvenile for possession of a con-\ntrolled substance and later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor\ntheft; that he had gang-related tattoos; and that he had at-\ntacked prison officials while awaiting trial.\n   This Court held counsel deficient for failing to pursue\n\u201cample opportunit[ies]\u201d to \u201crebut critical aggravating evi-\ndence.\u201d Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). First, this\nCourt noted that although the State relied heavily on An-\ndrus\u2019 acts of aggression while detained in TYC custody, in-\nvestigation would have shown \u201cthat [his] behavioral prob-\nlems [in TYC custody] were notably mild, and the harms he\nsustained severe.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14). The Court\ncited evidence from a TYC ombudsman who testified that it\nwas \u201c \u2018surpris[ing] how few\u2019 citations Andrus received, \u2018par-\nticularly in the dorms where [Andrus] was\u2019 housed,\u201d and\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                      15\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat there was \u201c \u2018nothing uncommon\u2019 about Andrus\u2019 alterca-\ntions because \u2018sometimes you . . . have to fight to get by\u2019 in\nthe \u2018violent atmosphere\u2019 and \u2018savage environment.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n___, n. 2 (slip op., at 14, n. 2). Indeed, habeas evidence es-\ntablished that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Andrus\u2019 citations at\nTYC were for \u201cdisruption of program,\u201d which could include\n\u201ctalking out of turn.\u201d 5 Habeas Tr. 174; 13 id., Def. Exh. 4,\np. 7.6 Meanwhile, although Andrus was removed from the\ngeneral population 77 times, approximately half of those\nwere not punishments but \u201cself-referrals\u201d that he initiated\nto seek refuge from the \u201cviolent \u2018Lord of the Flies\u2019 scenario\u201d\nand \u201cbrutal pecking order\u201d within TYC, despite the unique\nhorrors attended to isolation. 5 id., at 155\u2013156, 179, 183,\n189, 204\u2013205. As noted, TYC officials also punished Andrus\nwith isolation for reporting that he was hearing voices. Id.,\nat 183; Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).\n   In view of this evidence, this Court explained: \u201c[W]ith suf-\nficient understanding of the violent environments Andrus\ninhabited his entire life, counsel could have provided a\ncounternarrative of Andrus\u2019 later episodes in prison.\u201d Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14). \u201c[I]nstead, counsel left all of that\naggravating evidence untouched at trial\u2014even going so far\nas to inform the jury that the evidence made it \u2018probabl[e]\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 For example, Andrus was cited for \u201cthrowing a paperclip,\u201d \u201cshooting\n\na rubber band,\u201d \u201ctalking while standing in line or . . . in the lunch room,\u201d\nand \u201ceating a cookie in class.\u201d 5 Habeas Tr. 174; see also id., at 187 (\u201cI\nsaw once he asked for a calculator. . . . Violated dress code, usually that\nmeans your shirt is not tucked in. He was talking during quiet time.\nTalked once after the lights were out\u201d). TYC staff also issued citations\nsimply to prove their work ethic to supervisors, or even for \u201cself-referrals\u201d\nto isolation. Id., at 176\u2013177. Given all of this, the TYC ombudsman ex-\nplained, after reviewing about 1,000 pages of TYC records, that Andrus\u2019\nnumber of citations was in fact \u201caverage or pretty low.\u201d Id., at 177. Yet\nthe jury heard none of this context. Instead, jurors heard largely unchal-\nlenged testimony (which the State emphasized in closing) suggesting\nthat Andrus had received age-appropriate care and rejected a resociali-\nzation program, see 48 Tr. 60\u201361, 68\u201369, 73\u201374; 52 id., at 31, a program\nthat was later discontinued and discredited, see n. 3, supra.\n\f16                   ANDRUS v. TEXAS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat Andrus was \u2018a violent kind of guy.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n   Although this Court \u201cdescribed [Andrus\u2019] infractions at\nTYC as \u2018notably mild,\u2019 \u201d the Court of Criminal Appeals be-\nlieved \u201ca jury would have been convinced otherwise.\u201d 622\nS. W. 3d, at 901. The Texas court relied heavily on Andrus\u2019\n295 citations, including threats and assaults, and the 77\ntimes he was \u201cremove[d] . . . from the general population\u201d\n(i.e., placed in solitary confinement) before his transfer to\nadult prison. Ibid. In the court\u2019s view, this proved Andrus\n\u201cwas far more dangerous and disruptive than the typical\njuvenile held in custody of TYC,\u201d evidence that categorically\n\u201coutweighed\u201d the conditions at TYC. Id., at 902.\n   The Court of Criminal Appeals doubly erred here. First,\nits assessment was irreconcilable with any reasonable anal-\nysis of Andrus\u2019 TYC record or with this Court\u2019s careful rec-\nitation of the record evidence. The Texas court relied on a\nmere sliver of the evidence: the overall numbers of times\nAndrus was cited or isolated (numbers that, as this Court\npreviously explained, the record shows to be inflated) and\nthe violent nature of some of his infractions. This Court\nconsidered that evidence and more, and it reached a directly\ncontrary conclusion based on expert testimony (found cred-\nible by the state habeas court) that placed those infractions\nin context. See Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___, ___\u2013___, and n. 2\n(slip op., at 6, 13\u201314, and n. 2).\n   Second, this Court\u2019s precedents teach that even if \u201cit is\npossible that a jury could have heard [all of the mitigating\nevidence] and still have decided on the death penalty, that\nis not the test.\u201d Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 393\n(2005). The likelihood of a different result \u201cmust be sub-\nstantial, not just conceivable,\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562\nU. S. 86, 112 (2011), but \u201c[w]e do not require a defendant to\nshow that counsel\u2019s deficient conduct more likely than not\naltered the outcome of his penalty proceeding,\u201d Porter, 558\nU. S., at 44 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover,\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                    17\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhere, the likelihood of a different result need only be estab-\nlished as to one juror, not a unanimous jury. Andrus, 590\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17). Given the sheer volume of ev-\nidence supporting this Court\u2019s view of Andrus\u2019 TYC record,\nit is difficult to conclude that every reasonable juror would\nhave rejected it. By reasoning otherwise, the court below\nappeared to hold Andrus to an improper standard.\n   Beyond Andrus\u2019 TYC record, this Court found counsel\nhad been deficient by failing to rebut the State\u2019s reliance on\nAndrus\u2019 alleged commission of a knifepoint robbery at a\ndry-cleaning business. The Court noted that the State\nnever charged Andrus for this robbery and that \u201cthe only\nevidence originally tying Andrus to the incident was a lone\nwitness statement, later recanted by the witness, that led\nto the inclusion of Andrus\u2019 photograph in a belated photo\narray, which the police admitted gave rise to numerous re-\nliability concerns.\u201d Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op.,\nat 14\u201315) (footnote omitted). \u201cThe very problem\u201d was that\nthe jury heard the State\u2019s account, \u201cbut not any of the sig-\nnificant evidence that would have cast doubt on Andrus\u2019 in-\nvolvement in the offense at all.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).\n   The Court of Criminal Appeals, on remand, found that\nAndrus had not been prejudiced by this failure because alt-\nhough \u201c[t]he Supreme Court discounted\u201d the State\u2019s prior-\ncrimes evidence, it \u201cd[id] not.\u201d 622 S. W. 3d, at 902. On the\nuncharged dry-cleaning robbery, the Texas court disap-\nproved of this Court\u2019s \u201cquestion[ing of] the reliability of the\n[pretrial, photo-array] identification,\u201d which it \u201cd[id] not\njudge . . . to be unduly suggestive.\u201d Id., at 903\u2013904. The\nTexas court also second-guessed this Court\u2019s reliance on the\nwitness\u2019 recantation and habeas testimony. Id., at 904.\nHere again, the court squarely rejected this Court\u2019s analy-\nsis of the evidence on the performance prong to deny relief\non the prejudice prong.7 Moreover, the court overlooked\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 7 The court disagreed with this Court\u2019s characterization of a detective\u2019s\n\f18                           ANDRUS v. TEXAS\n\n                         SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwhat this Court deemed \u201c[t]he very problem\u201d with counsel\u2019s\nfailures: that the jury never heard any of the bases on which\nthe statement and photo identification (made months after\nthe incident by a victim who initially could tell the police\nonly that he had been assaulted by \u201ca black man,\u201d see 3 Ha-\nbeas Tr. 65) were vulnerable to attack. Again, the issue is\nnot whether habeas evidence conclusively establishes An-\ndrus\u2019 innocence of the uncharged robbery, but whether it\nwould be reasonably probable to lead one juror to strike a\ndifferent balance.\n    The Court of Criminal Appeals also disputed this Court\u2019s\nanalysis of the aggravated robbery for which Andrus was\nsentenced to TYC. The Texas court charged this Court with\n\u201cdiscount[ing] this crime\u201d because this Court said Andrus\n\u201c \u2018allegedly\u2019 act[ed] as a \u2018lookout.\u2019 \u201d 622 S. W. 3d, at 902. Cit-\ning its opinion on direct appeal (from before the habeas\nhearing), the Texas court opined that the victim had iden-\ntified Andrus as the gunman by his clothing. Ibid. The\nTexas court noted this Court\u2019s contrary determination, but\nconcluded that \u201c[t]he trial evidence solidly pointed to [An-\ndrus] as the gunman.\u201d Id., at 902\u2013903. It thus reached an-\nother result that contradicted a conclusion of this Court.\nSee Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___, n. 1 (slip op., at 6, n. 1). To\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntestimony regarding the reliability of the pretrial photo-array identifica-\ntion, but the detective in fact conceded the relevant point. See 8 Habeas\nTr. 35 (\u201cQ: . . . Only one of [the men in the array] is looking directly up\nand out. Do you see that? And that\u2019s Terence Andrus? A: Yes. [Number]\n3 may be looking out, but I understand your point\u201d). In any event, this\nCourt clearly considered and rejected the Texas court\u2019s precise argu-\nment. Compare 622 S. W. 3d, at 903, with 590 U. S., at ___, and n. 4 (slip\nop., at 15, and n. 4); id., at ___, n. 4 (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 6,\nn. 4). Similarly, for the witness\u2019 recantation and habeas testimony, this\nCourt already considered and rejected all of the court below\u2019s arguments\nsave one (the witness\u2019 relationship with Andrus) in its exchange with the\ndissent. Compare 622 S. W. 3d, at 904, with Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___,\nn. 4 (slip op., at 15, n. 4); id., at ___, and nn. 3, 4 (ALITO, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 6, and nn. 3, 4).\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)           19\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nbe sure, as the Texas court noted, this Court erroneously\nsaid that \u201cthe victim described at least two individuals as\nwearing such clothing,\u201d ibid. (emphasis added), when it\nshould have said that a responding sergeant described at\nleast two individuals as wearing such clothing, see 46 Tr.\n25\u201327. The point stands, however: The victim could not\nidentify faces or individuals, only clothing, and Andrus was\nnot the only individual wearing the clothing identified by\nthe victim. More broadly, the Texas court once again\nseemed to apply a heightened prejudice standard by dis-\nmissing the possibility that even one juror might agree with\nthis Court\u2019s assessment of the evidence. See Wiggins, 539\nU. S., at 537\u2013538 (prejudice requires only \u201ca reasonable\nprobability that at least one juror would have struck a dif-\nferent balance\u201d of a capital defendant\u2019s \u201cmoral culpability\u201d).\n                              3\n   Conclusion. Aside from the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019\ndescription of the undisputed brutality of Andrus\u2019 capital\ncrime and its accounting of his violence while incarcerated\npending trial, see 622 S. W. 3d, at 902, 904\u2013905, its analysis\nof prejudice impermissibly contravened the reasoning on\nwhich this Court relied to find deficient performance. The\nCourt of Criminal Appeals also declined to account for sub-\nstantial record evidence that undercut its conclusions and\nmisapplied the relevant legal standards.\n   Even the State, in its brief opposing certiorari, does not\nmeaningfully attempt to reconcile the Court of Criminal\nAppeals\u2019 reasoning with this Court\u2019s prior decision. In-\nstead, the State echoes the Texas court\u2019s critiques of that\nprecedent, repeatedly attacking it rather than accepting its\npremises as settled.

S. ___, ___ (2019) (per curiam) (slip op., at 10).\nIt is impossible reasonably to disagree with the state ha-\nbeas court and the dissenting judges below: There exists a\nreasonable probability that, had counsel presented the evi-\ndence uncovered on habeas review, at least one juror would\nhave struck a different balance.\n   At sentencing, the jury heard next to nothing \u201cthat would\nhumanize [Andrus] or allow [the jury] to accurately gauge\nhis moral culpability.\u201d Porter, 558 U. S., at 41. Andrus\u2019\nmother offered only a sparse chronology of his childhood\nand painted a counterproductive portrait of that period of\nhis life as relatively tranquil. Andrus\u2019 biological father, who\nalso testified at sentencing, hardly knew Andrus (having\nbeen absent or incarcerated for almost all of his childhood)\nand could venture only that Andrus seemed \u201cgood around\n[him]\u201d the one year they lived together. 50 Tr. 8. Counsel\u2019s\ndirect examination of Andrus about his childhood was cur-\nsory (constituting about four pages of the trial transcript)\nand followed the contrary testimony of his mother. The\nonly potentially mitigating evidence, then, was (1) a lone\nexpert\u2019s generalized opinion that drugs can hamper the ad-\nolescent brain\u2019s ability to make sound judgments, and (2)\nlay testimony that Andrus\u2019 \u201cantisocial personality disorder\u201d\nled him to be \u201cmanipulative\u201d and that Andrus had begun to\nvocalize remorse in the prior two months. 51 id., at 34, 37.\nBut the former point hardly needs proof (as the State\npointed out, see Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)),\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

All told, the jury heard hardly a whisper\nof the appalling circumstances that marred Andrus\u2019 child-\nhood and adolescence, enabling the State to assert while\ncross-examining Andrus that the jury never \u201cheard one mit-\nigating circumstance in [his] life.\u201d 51 Tr. 60.\n  Meanwhile, \u201cthere exists too much mitigating evidence\nthat was not presented to now be ignored.\u201d Porter, 558\nU. S., at 44 (internal quotation marks omitted). The jury\nnever heard the extensive reports that, throughout Andrus\u2019\nchildhood, Andrus\u2019 mother was often too drugged to pay at-\ntention to her children, had a string of abusive and drug-\naddicted boyfriends, and frequently left her five children to\nfend for themselves while she went out and took drugs for\nextended periods. The jury never heard the details regard-\ning the physical abuse young Andrus reportedly suffered,\nthe domestic violence he witnessed, or the sexual abuse that\ntore a beloved younger sibling from his home. The jury\nnever heard the poignant accounts by Andrus\u2019 siblings of\nhow Andrus had cared and provided for them when their\nparents would not. The jury never heard expert testimony\nthat the severe neglect and privation Andrus suffered as a\nchild left him damaged and emotionally stunted.8 The jury\nnever heard about the harrowing experiences Andrus en-\ndured in the TYC system, the damaging effects of his pro-\nlonged periods of isolation there, and the utter lack of ap-\npropriate support he received. The jury never heard about\nthe line Andrus\u2019 experts later drew between all of this hard-\nship and trauma and the trajectory of his life. The jury\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 This Court has repeatedly recognized the potency of childhood neglect\n\nand exposure to violence as mitigating evidence in capital punishment\nproceedings, even where it does not directly rebut the prosecution\u2019s ar-\nguments for death. See, e.g., Porter, 558 U. S., at 33, 43; Rompilla v.\nBeard, 545 U. S. 374, 392 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 525\n(2003); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 395 (2000).\n\f22                   ANDRUS v. TEXAS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nnever heard about Andrus\u2019 diagnosis with affective psycho-\nsis or his various other mitigating mental-health issues.\nThese scores of lengthy reports went well beyond anything\nin Andrus\u2019 brief trial testimony, which was uncorroborated\nat trial and undermined by his own mother. All of this \u201cac-\ncumulated [evidence] would have destroyed the benign con-\nception of [Andrus\u2019] upbringing and mental capacity de-\nfense counsel had formed.\u201d Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 391.\n  The State\u2019s unrebutted aggravating evidence, to be sure,\nwas forceful. The evidence of Andrus\u2019 violent behavior and\ndefiance while detained, however, could have been under-\nstood in a much different light had counsel investigated and\npresented the significant body of mitigating evidence re-\nvealed at the habeas hearing. As noted, there was \u201cnothing\nuncommon\u201d about the citations Andrus received for violent\nbehavior while in TYC custody; given the \u201csavage\u201d environ-\nment, the TYC ombudsman was \u201csurprised how few\u201d inci-\ndents were noted in Andrus\u2019 record. 5 Habeas Tr. 189. An-\ndrus\u2019 exceptionally turbulent introduction to the state\ndetention system, a punishment for his inability to succeed\nin a failed and discredited program when he was 16, also\nmay have influenced how the jury evaluated his later inci-\ndents of violence in prison. Especially considering the se-\nvere neglect Andrus experienced as a child, the jury could\nhave viewed his aggressive behavior as borne out of deep-\nseated distrust of others. See Sears, 561 U. S., at 951.\n  Beyond that, untapped evidence could have blunted the\nforce of the State\u2019s other aggravating circumstances. As the\nhabeas evidence revealed, counsel could have introduced\nsignificant doubt regarding the State\u2019s linking of Andrus to\nthe uncharged dry-cleaning robbery. As for the State\u2019s sug-\ngestion that Andrus lacked remorse because he appeared to\nexpress it only shortly before trial, evidence of his mental-\nhealth struggles, culminating in his suicide attempt while\nincarcerated pending trial, could have persuaded the jury\nthat he was battling inner turmoil far beyond what he was\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                   23\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nable to vocalize.9\n  In sum, effective counsel would have painted a vividly dif-\nferent tableau of aggravating and mitigating evidence than\nwas presented at trial. During the punishment phase, the\nState\u2019s aggravating evidence went largely unchallenged,\nwhile the defense\u2019s mitigating evidence consisted of a few\nbiographical facts about Andrus and some damaging infor-\nmation that tended to portray Andrus as morally culpable.\nIn contrast, if measured against \u201cthe totality of the availa-\nble mitigation evidence,\u201d Williams, 529 U. S., at 397, the\nState\u2019s aggravating evidence would have appeared dramat-\nically different, while the defense\u2019s case in mitigation would\nhave gone from counterproductive to compelling. Given\nthat sea change, I find it clear that the \u201ctidal wave,\u201d 7 Ha-\nbeas Tr. 101, of \u201cavailable mitigating evidence, taken as a\nwhole, \u2018might well have influenced the jury\u2019s appraisal\u2019 of\n[Andrus\u2019] moral culpability,\u201d Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 538\n(quoting Williams, 529 U. S., at 398). Because there is a\nreasonable probability that \u201cat least one juror would have\nstruck a different balance,\u201d Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 537, I\nwould summarily reverse.\n                             III\n  I dissent with full recognition that summary reversal is\n\u201ca rare disposition, usually reserved by this Court for situ-\nations in which the law is settled and stable, the facts are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 After trial, once Andrus was in a safe environment and was no longer\n\nbeing prescribed clinically \u201cinappropriate\u201d medications, habeas evidence\nindicated that he had \u201cvirtually no record of misconduct\u201d in prison. 7\nHabeas Tr. 51. Andrus now produces visual art and poetry, see\nhttps://www.terenceandrus.com, and published an essay reflecting on\nthis Court\u2019s prior decision in his case, see T. Andrus, Reflection on An-\ndrus v. Texas, 134 Harv. L. Rev. Forum 78 (2020). Although the sentenc-\ning jury would not have known of these facts, they are not inconsequen-\ntial: They underscore the force of Andrus\u2019 mental-health mitigation\nevidence and demonstrate his potential for moral redemption, a potential\nthat the jury was never given an opportunity to see.\n\f24                     ANDRUS v. TEXAS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nnot in dispute, and the decision below is clearly in error.\u201d\nSchweiker v. Hansen, 450 U. S. 785, 791 (1981) (Marshall,\nJ., dissenting). Rightly so. This Court must exercise its\ncertiorari jurisdiction and apply its resources in a manner\nthat entrusts the lower courts with the diligent and proper\nresolution of individual cases.\n   Even so, summary dispositions remain appropriate in\ntruly extraordinary cases involving categories of errors that\nstrike at the heart of our legal system. Cf., e.g., City and\nCounty of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 575 U. S. 600, 611, n. 3\n(2015) (explaining that error correction is warranted where\nan issue has particular \u201cimportance . . . \u2018to society as a\nwhole\u2019 \u201d). This is certainly true in capital cases like this one,\nwhere the life-or-death stakes engender a special \u201cneed for\nreliability in the determination that death is the appropri-\nate punishment in a specific case.\u201d Woodson v. North Car-\nolina, 428 U. S. 280, 305 (1976) (plurality opinion).\n   Summary correction is particularly necessary where, as\nhere, a lower court clearly and directly contravenes this\nCourt\u2019s settled precedent. See, e.g., Bosse v. Oklahoma, 580\nU. S. 1 (2016) (per curiam). That is all the more so when\nthis Court remands and the subsequent lower court opin-\nion, \u201cwhen taken as a whole and when read in the light both\nof our prior opinion and the . . . record, rests upon analysis\ntoo much of which too closely resembles what we previously\nfound improper.\u201d Moore, 586 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nSuch defiance of vertical stare decisis, if allowed to stand,\nsubstantially erodes confidence in the functioning of the le-\ngal system.\n   That is precisely what this Court permits today. As I\nhave explained, and as the dissenting judges below warned,\nthe Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 opinion on remand cannot\nbe reconciled with this Court\u2019s prior opinion, let alone with\nthe habeas record. In fact, the Texas court repeatedly indi-\ncated its disdain for this Court\u2019s conclusions. At bottom,\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)           25\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwere the Texas court\u2019s characterizations of the record cor-\nrect, this Court hardly could have found deficient perfor-\nmance. These errors are especially damaging because they\nbear on the right to effective assistance of counsel, the very\n\u201cfoundation for our adversary system,\u201d Martinez v. Ryan,\n566 U. S. 1, 12 (2012), in a capital case where the stakes\ncould not be higher. If summary reversal is ever warranted,\nit is warranted here.\n   This Court\u2019s failure to act does not mark the end of the\nroad for Andrus. He still may seek federal habeas review\nof the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 ultimate denial of relief,\na denial that plainly \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unrea-\nsonable application of, clearly established\u201d precedents of\nthis Court. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). The Court\u2019s refusal to-\nday to exercise its discretionary certiorari jurisdiction must\nnot be misinterpreted to foreclose such relief. Nevertheless,\nthe Court\u2019s refusal is lamentable. In view of the egregious\nnature of the errors below, the overwhelming record evi-\ndence, the unparalleled stakes for Andrus, and the im-\nportance of protecting and enforcing vertical stare decisis, I\nwould not leave such errors unresolved, and I respectfully\ndissent.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                  Cite as: 596 U.

As a result, the dissenting\njudges below explained, the Texas court\u2019s opinion was irrec-\noncilable with this Court\u2019s prior decision and barred by ver-\ntical stare decisis and the law of the case.\n   I agree with the dissenting judges below. Andrus\u2019 case\ncries out for intervention, and it is particularly vital that\nthis Court act when necessary to protect against defiance of\nits precedents. The Court, however, denies certiorari. I\nwould summarily reverse, and I respectfully dissent from\nthe Court\u2019s failure to do so.\n                                I\n                               A\n   This Court\u2019s prior decision outlined the events of Andrus\u2019\ntrial and habeas proceedings. See Andrus, 590 U. S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 2\u20137). Only a brief summary follows.\n   In 2008, at age 20, Andrus killed Avelino Diaz and a by-\nstander, Kim-Phuong Vu Bui, during an unsuccessful car-\njacking while under the influence of PCP-laced marijuana.\nThe State charged Andrus with capital murder. At the guilt\nphase of trial, Andrus\u2019 counsel did not put on a defense case\nand informed the jury, in closing, that \u201cthe punishment\nphase\u201d was \u201cwhere we are going to be fighting.\u201d 45 Tr. 18.\n   But defense counsel hardly put up a fight at the punish-\nment phase.

In\naddition, by relying on the 2005 TYC report to discount the\npossibility that Andrus suffered physical abuse, the court\nnot only overlooked the habeas evidence of the details of his\nbeatings but also neglected to address expert testimony es-\ntablishing that it was \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cexpected\u201d for juvenile\ndetainees to \u201cdeny having problems\u201d in their homes so as to\navoid displaying weakness. 7 Habeas Tr. 32.2\n   As to the purported overlap, the Court of Criminal Ap-\npeals stressed that some \u201cevidence about family dysfunc-\ntion\u201d was presented to the jury. 622 S.

But a testifying expert on habeas\nreview, found credible by the state habeas court, testified that the TYC\nanalysts\u2019 views were inconsistent, unreliable, and potentially pretextual,\nsee 7 Habeas Tr. 78\u201380, 85; 1 Supp. Clerk\u2019s Record 15, and still other\nexpert testimony (again, found credible) showed that TYC\u2019s mental-\nhealth program at the time lacked adequate oversight, staffing, and qual-\nity assurance, see 5 Habeas Tr. 161\u2013162; 13 id., Def. Exh. 4, at 6; 1 Supp.\nClerk\u2019s Record 13. The Texas court did not so much as mention this con-\ntrary evidence.\n\f14                     ANDRUS v.

See\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071, \u00a72(b)(1). To that\nend, it put forth evidence that Andrus had been hostile and\nviolent in TYC custody; that he had committed an un-\ncharged aggravated robbery of a dry-cleaning business; that\nhe had been involved in an aggravated robbery as a teen-\nager, for which he was sent to TYC detention; that he had\nalso been adjudicated as a juvenile for possession of a con-\ntrolled substance and later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor\ntheft; that he had gang-related tattoos; and that he had at-\ntacked prison officials while awaiting trial.\n   This Court held counsel deficient for failing to pursue\n\u201cample opportunit[ies]\u201d to \u201crebut critical aggravating evi-\ndence.\u201d Andrus, 590 U.

As noted, TYC officials also punished Andrus\nwith isolation for reporting that he was hearing voices. Id.,\nat 183; Andrus, 590 U.

Yet\nthe jury heard none of this context. Instead, jurors heard largely unchal-\nlenged testimony (which the State emphasized in closing) suggesting\nthat Andrus had received age-appropriate care and rejected a resociali-\nzation program, see 48 Tr. 60\u201361, 68\u201369, 73\u201374; 52 id., at 31, a program\nthat was later discontinued and discredited, see n. 3, supra.\n\f16                   ANDRUS v.

W. 3d, at 901. The Texas court relied heavily on Andrus\u2019\n295 citations, including threats and assaults, and the 77\ntimes he was \u201cremove[d] . . . from the general population\u201d\n(i.e., placed in solitary confinement) before his transfer to\nadult prison. Ibid. In the court\u2019s view, this proved Andrus\n\u201cwas far more dangerous and disruptive than the typical\njuvenile held in custody of TYC,\u201d evidence that categorically\n\u201coutweighed\u201d the conditions at TYC. Id., at 902.\n   The Court of Criminal Appeals doubly erred here. First,\nits assessment was irreconcilable with any reasonable anal-\nysis of Andrus\u2019 TYC record or with this Court\u2019s careful rec-\nitation of the record evidence. The Texas court relied on a\nmere sliver of the evidence: the overall numbers of times\nAndrus was cited or isolated (numbers that, as this Court\npreviously explained, the record shows to be inflated) and\nthe violent nature of some of his infractions. This Court\nconsidered that evidence and more, and it reached a directly\ncontrary conclusion based on expert testimony (found cred-\nible by the state habeas court) that placed those infractions\nin context. See Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___, ___\u2013___, and n. 2\n(slip op., at 6, 13\u201314, and n. 2).\n   Second, this Court\u2019s precedents teach that even if \u201cit is\npossible that a jury could have heard [all of the mitigating\nevidence] and still have decided on the death penalty, that\nis not the test.\u201d Rompilla v.

Andrus, 590\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17). Given the sheer volume of ev-\nidence supporting this Court\u2019s view of Andrus\u2019 TYC record,\nit is difficult to conclude that every reasonable juror would\nhave rejected it. By reasoning otherwise, the court below\nappeared to hold Andrus to an improper standard.\n   Beyond Andrus\u2019 TYC record, this Court found counsel\nhad been deficient by failing to rebut the State\u2019s reliance on\nAndrus\u2019 alleged commission of a knifepoint robbery at a\ndry-cleaning business. The Court noted that the State\nnever charged Andrus for this robbery and that \u201cthe only\nevidence originally tying Andrus to the incident was a lone\nwitness statement, later recanted by the witness, that led\nto the inclusion of Andrus\u2019 photograph in a belated photo\narray, which the police admitted gave rise to numerous re-\nliability concerns.\u201d Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op.,\nat 14\u201315) (footnote omitted). \u201cThe very problem\u201d was that\nthe jury heard the State\u2019s account, \u201cbut not any of the sig-\nnificant evidence that would have cast doubt on Andrus\u2019 in-\nvolvement in the offense at all.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756/porter-v-mccollum/\">Id.,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at ___ (slip op., at 15).\n   The Court of Criminal Appeals, on remand, found that\nAndrus had not been prejudiced by this failure because alt-\nhough \u201c[t]he Supreme Court discounted\u201d the State\u2019s prior-\ncrimes evidence, it \u201cd[id] not.\u201d 622 S. W. 3d, at 902. On the\nuncharged dry-cleaning robbery, the Texas court disap-\nproved of this Court\u2019s \u201cquestion[ing of] the reliability of the\n[pretrial, photo-array] identification,\u201d which it \u201cd[id] not\njudge . . . to be unduly suggestive.\u201d Id., at 903\u2013904. The\nTexas court also second-guessed this Court\u2019s reliance on the\nwitness\u2019 recantation and habeas testimony. Id., at 904.\nHere again, the court squarely rejected this Court\u2019s analy-\nsis of the evidence on the performance prong to deny relief\non the prejudice prong.7 Moreover, the court overlooked\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 7 The court disagreed with this Court\u2019s characterization of a detective\u2019s\n\f18                           ANDRUS v. TEXAS\n\n                         SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwhat this Court deemed \u201c[t]he very problem\u201d with counsel\u2019s\nfailures: that the jury never heard any of the bases on which\nthe statement and photo identification (made months after\nthe incident by a victim who initially could tell the police\nonly that he had been assaulted by \u201ca black man,\u201d see 3 Ha-\nbeas Tr. 65) were vulnerable to attack. Again, the issue is\nnot whether habeas evidence conclusively establishes An-\ndrus\u2019 innocence of the uncharged robbery, but whether it\nwould be reasonably probable to lead one juror to strike a\ndifferent balance.\n    The Court of Criminal Appeals also disputed this Court\u2019s\nanalysis of the aggravated robbery for which Andrus was\nsentenced to TYC. The Texas court charged this Court with\n\u201cdiscount[ing] this crime\u201d because this Court said Andrus\n\u201c \u2018allegedly\u2019 act[ed] as a \u2018lookout.\u2019 \u201d 622 S. W. 3d, at 902. Cit-\ning its opinion on direct appeal (from before the habeas\nhearing), the Texas court opined that the victim had iden-\ntified Andrus as the gunman by his clothing. Ibid. The\nTexas court noted this Court\u2019s contrary determination, but\nconcluded that \u201c[t]he trial evidence solidly pointed to [An-\ndrus] as the gunman.\u201d Id., at 902\u2013903. It thus reached an-\nother result that contradicted a conclusion of this Court.\nSee Andrus, 590 U. S., at ___, n. 1 (slip op., at 6, n. 1). To\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntestimony regarding the reliability of the pretrial photo-array identifica-\ntion, but the detective in fact conceded the relevant point. See 8 Habeas\nTr. 35 (\u201cQ: . . . Only one of [the men in the array] is looking directly up\nand out. Do you see that? And that\u2019s Terence Andrus? A: Yes. [Number]\n3 may be looking out, but I understand your point\u201d). In any event, this\nCourt clearly considered and rejected the Texas court\u2019s precise argu-\nment. Compare 622 S. W. 3d, at 903, with 590 U. S., at ___, and n. 4 (slip\nop., at 15, and n. 4); id., at ___, n. 4 (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 6,\nn. 4). Similarly, for the witness\u2019 recantation and habeas testimony, this\nCourt already considered and rejected all of the court below\u2019s arguments\nsave one (the witness\u2019 relationship with Andrus) in its exchange with the\ndissent. Compare 622 S. W. 3d, at 904, with Andrus, 590 U.

(emphasis added), when it\nshould have said that a responding sergeant described at\nleast two individuals as wearing such clothing, see 46 Tr.\n25\u201327. The point stands, however: The victim could not\nidentify faces or individuals, only clothing, and Andrus was\nnot the only individual wearing the clothing identified by\nthe victim. More broadly, the Texas court once again\nseemed to apply a heightened prejudice standard by dis-\nmissing the possibility that even one juror might agree with\nthis Court\u2019s assessment of the evidence. See Wiggins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\">539\nU.

Aside from the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019\ndescription of the undisputed brutality of Andrus\u2019 capital\ncrime and its accounting of his violence while incarcerated\npending trial, see 622 S. W. 3d, at 902, 904\u2013905, its analysis\nof prejudice impermissibly contravened the reasoning on\nwhich this Court relied to find deficient performance. The\nCourt of Criminal Appeals also declined to account for sub-\nstantial record evidence that undercut its conclusions and\nmisapplied the relevant legal standards.\n   Even the State, in its brief opposing certiorari, does not\nmeaningfully attempt to reconcile the Court of Criminal\nAppeals\u2019 reasoning with this Court\u2019s prior decision. In-\nstead, the State echoes the Texas court\u2019s critiques of that\nprecedent, repeatedly attacking it rather than accepting its\npremises as settled.

The evidence of Andrus\u2019 violent behavior and\ndefiance while detained, however, could have been under-\nstood in a much different light had counsel investigated and\npresented the significant body of mitigating evidence re-\nvealed at the habeas hearing. As noted, there was \u201cnothing\nuncommon\u201d about the citations Andrus received for violent\nbehavior while in TYC custody; given the \u201csavage\u201d environ-\nment, the TYC ombudsman was \u201csurprised how few\u201d inci-\ndents were noted in Andrus\u2019 record. 5 Habeas Tr. 189. An-\ndrus\u2019 exceptionally turbulent introduction to the state\ndetention system, a punishment for his inability to succeed\nin a failed and discredited program when he was 16, also\nmay have influenced how the jury evaluated his later inci-\ndents of violence in prison. Especially considering the se-\nvere neglect Andrus experienced as a child, the jury could\nhave viewed his aggressive behavior as borne out of deep-\nseated distrust of others. See Sears, 561 U. S., at 951.\n  Beyond that, untapped evidence could have blunted the\nforce of the State\u2019s other aggravating circumstances. As the\nhabeas evidence revealed, counsel could have introduced\nsignificant doubt regarding the State\u2019s linking of Andrus to\nthe uncharged dry-cleaning robbery. As for the State\u2019s sug-\ngestion that Andrus lacked remorse because he appeared to\nexpress it only shortly before trial, evidence of his mental-\nhealth struggles, culminating in his suicide attempt while\nincarcerated pending trial, could have persuaded the jury\nthat he was battling inner turmoil far beyond what he was\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

During the punishment phase, the\nState\u2019s aggravating evidence went largely unchallenged,\nwhile the defense\u2019s mitigating evidence consisted of a few\nbiographical facts about Andrus and some damaging infor-\nmation that tended to portray Andrus as morally culpable.\nIn contrast, if measured against \u201cthe totality of the availa-\nble mitigation evidence,\u201d Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\">529 U.

A stay pending certiorari is appropriate only\nif the Court is likely to grant review; certiorari is discretion-\nary; and the Court now denies the stay. I would agree with\nthat decision were it not for concern about the effect that\nthe Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation of 52 U. S. C.\n\u00a710101(a)(2)(B) may have in the federal and state elections\nthat will be held in Pennsylvania in November.\n   The Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation broke new ground, and\nat this juncture, it appears to me that that interpretation is\nvery likely wrong. If left undisturbed, it could well affect\nthe outcome of the fall elections, and it would be far better\nfor us to address that interpretation before, rather than af-\nter, it has that effect. I would therefore enter a stay pend-\ning certiorari and advise that any petition for certiorari and\nbrief in opposition should be filed expeditiously. If that is\ndone, the Court will be in a position to grant review, set an\nexpedited briefing schedule, and if necessary, set the case\nfor argument in October.\n\f2                    RITTER v. MIGLIORI\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   To illustrate why the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation is suf-\nficiently questionable and important to merit review, I offer\nthe following thoughts on the interpretation of the statute\nin question. As I will explain, it appears to me, based on\nthe review that I have been able to conduct in the time al-\nlowed, that the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation is very likely\nwrong. It seems plainly contrary to the statutory language,\nbut as is almost always the case when we decide whether to\ngrant emergency relief, I do not rule out the possibility that\nfurther briefing and argument might convince me that my\ncurrent view is unfounded. But with that caveat, I will pro-\nceed to discuss the statutory language.\n   The statutory provision in question reads as follows:\n       \u201cNo person acting under color of law shall . . . deny\n    the right of any individual to vote in any election be-\n    cause of an error or omission on any record or paper\n    related to any application, registration, or other act\n    requisite to voting, if such error or omission is not ma-\n    terial in determining whether such individual is quali-\n    fied under State law to vote in such election.\u201d\n    \u00a710101(a)(2)(B).\n   This provision has five elements: (1) the proscribed con-\nduct must be engaged in by a person who is \u201cacting under\ncolor of law\u201d; (2) it must have the effect of \u201cdeny[ing]\u201d an\nindividual \u201cthe right to vote\u201d; (3) this denial must be at-\ntributable to \u201can error or omission on [a] record or paper\u201d;\n(4) the \u201crecord or paper\u201d must be \u201crelated to [an] applica-\ntion, registration, or other act requisite to voting\u201d; and (5)\nthe error or omission must not be \u201cmaterial in determining\nwhether such individual is qualified under State law to vote\nin such election.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Third Circuit held that the failure to count mail-in\nballots that did not include the date on which they were\nfilled out constituted a violation of this provision, but the\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                     3\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nThird Circuit made little effort to explain how its interpre-\ntation can be reconciled with the language of the statute.\nIn my view, however, it appears that elements 2 and 5 are\nclearly not met.1\n   I will start with element 2. When a mail-in ballot is not\ncounted because it was not filled out correctly, the voter is\nnot denied \u201cthe right to vote.\u201d Rather, that individual\u2019s vote\nis not counted because he or she did not follow the rules for\ncasting a ballot. \u201cCasting a vote, whether by following the\ndirections for using a voting machine or completing a paper\nballot, requires compliance with certain rules.\u201d Brnovich v.\nDemocratic National Committee, 594 U. S. ___, ___ (2021)\n(slip op., at 16). A registered voter who does not follow the\nrules may be unable to cast a vote for any number of rea-\nsons. A voter may go to the polling place on the wrong day\nor after the polls have closed. A voter may go to the wrong\npolling place and may not have time to reach the right place\nbefore it is too late. A voter who casts a mail-in ballot may\nsend it to the wrong address. A State\u2019s refusal to count the\nvotes of these voters does not constitute a denial of \u201cthe\nright to vote.\u201d Even the most permissive voting rules must\ncontain some requirements, and the failure to follow those\nrules constitutes the forfeiture of the right to vote, not the\ndenial of that right.\n   Element 5 weighs even more heavily against the Third\nCircuit\u2019s interpretation. This element requires that the er-\nror or omission be \u201cmaterial in determining whether such\nindividual is qualified under State law to vote in such elec-\ntion.\u201d There is no reason why the requirements that must\nbe met in order to register (and thus be \u201cqualified\u201d) to vote\nshould be the same as the requirements that must be met\nin order to cast a ballot that will be counted. Indeed, it\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Elements 1 and 3 are satisfied, but for the reasons explained below,\n\nsee n. 2, infra, the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation is not consistent with\nthe most natural reading of element 4.\n\f4                     RITTER v. MIGLIORI\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwould be silly to think otherwise. Think of the previously\nmentioned hypothetical voters whose votes were not\ncounted because they did not follow the rules for casting a\nvote. None of the rules they violated\u2014rules setting the date\nof an election, the location of the voter\u2019s assigned polling\nplace, the address to which a mail-in ballot must be sent\u2014\nhas anything to do with the requirements that must be met\nin order to establish eligibility to vote, and it would be ab-\nsurd to judge the validity of voting rules based on whether\nthey are material to eligibility.\n   Under Pennsylvania law, a person is qualified to vote if\nhe or she is at least 18 years old on the day of the election,\nhas been a citizen of the State for at least one month, has\nlived in the relevant election district for at least 30 days,\nand is not imprisoned for a felony. See 25 Pa. Cons. Stat.\n\u00a71301 (2002). Other requirements must be met in order for\na mail-in ballot to be counted. Among other things, a stat-\nute provides that a voter \u201cshall . . . fill out, date and sign\u201d a\ndeclaration printed on the outer security envelope in which\nthe actual ballot is sealed. S. 422, 2020 Gen. Assem., Reg.\nSess. (Pa.), codified at Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 25, \u00a73150.16(a)\n(emphasis added); see also Migliori v. Lehigh County Bd. of\nElections, No. 5:22\u2013cv\u20130397 (ED Pa., Mar. 16, 2022), App.\nto Application 23a\u201324a. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court\nhas held that the inclusion of the date on which the ballot\nwas filled out is mandatory and that undated ballots cannot\nbe counted, see In re Canvass of Absentee and Mail-in Bal-\nlots of Nov. 3, 2020 General Election, 241 A. 3d 1058 (Pa.\n2020), but the Third Circuit held that this state-law rule is\npreempted by 52 U. S. C. \u00a710101(a)(2)(B) because the inclu-\nsion of a date is not material to the question whether a per-\nson is qualified to vote.\n   Can that possibly be correct? One may argue that the\ninclusion of a date does not serve any strong purpose and\nthat a voter\u2019s failure to date a ballot should not cause the\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                       5\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nballot to be disqualified. But \u00a710101(a)(2)(B) does not ad-\ndress that issue. It applies only to errors or omissions that\nare not material to the question whether a person is quali-\nfied to vote. It leaves it to the States to decide which voting\nrules should be mandatory.\n   The problem with the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation can\nbe illustrated by considering what would happen if it were\napplied to a mail-in voting rule that is indisputably im-\nportant, namely, the requirement that a mail-in ballot be\nsigned. Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 25, \u00a73150.16(a). Suppose a\nvoter did not personally sign his or her ballot but instead\ninstructed another person to complete the ballot and sign it\nusing the standard notation employed when a letter is\nsigned for someone else: \u201cp. p. John or Jane Doe.\u201d Or sup-\npose that a voter, for some reason, typed his or her name\ninstead of signing it. Those violations would be material in\ndetermining whether a ballot should be counted, but they\nwould not be \u201cmaterial in determining whether such indi-\nvidual is qualified under State law to vote in such election.\u201d\nTherefore, under the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation, a ballot\nsigned by a third party and a ballot with a typed name ra-\nther than a signature would have to be counted. It seems\nmost unlikely that this is what 52 U. S. C. \u00a710101(a)(2)(B)\nmeans.2\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 In light of what I have written about elements 2 and 5, it is unlikely\n\nthat element 4 must be addressed, but for the sake of completeness, I\nwill add that the language of that provision must be given a strained\nmeaning in order to make it applicable to the validity of a rule about\nfilling out a mail-in ballot. Element 4 demands that a \u201crecord or paper\u201d\nmust be \u201crelated to [an] application, registration, or other act requisite\nto voting.\u201d 52 U. S. C. \u00a710101(a)(2)(B). A mail-in ballot is a \u201crecord or\npaper,\u201d and it does not appear to be related in any direct sense to any\n\u201capplication\u201d or \u201cregistration,\u201d so the question is whether it is \u201crelated\nto\u201d some \u201cother act requisite to voting.\u201d But the casting of a ballot con-\nstitutes the act of voting. Indeed, the statute specifies that \u201cthe word\n\u2018vote\u2019 includes all action necessary to make a vote effective including . . .\n\f6                        RITTER v.

C.\n\u00a710101</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(2)(B) may have in the federal and state elections\nthat will be held in Pennsylvania in November.\n   The Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation broke new ground, and\nat this juncture, it appears to me that that interpretation is\nvery likely wrong. If left undisturbed, it could well affect\nthe outcome of the fall elections, and it would be far better\nfor us to address that interpretation before, rather than af-\nter, it has that effect. I would therefore enter a stay pend-\ning certiorari and advise that any petition for certiorari and\nbrief in opposition should be filed expeditiously. If that is\ndone, the Court will be in a position to grant review, set an\nexpedited briefing schedule, and if necessary, set the case\nfor argument in October.\n\f2                    RITTER v. MIGLIORI\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   To illustrate why the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation is suf-\nficiently questionable and important to merit review, I offer\nthe following thoughts on the interpretation of the statute\nin question. As I will explain, it appears to me, based on\nthe review that I have been able to conduct in the time al-\nlowed, that the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation is very likely\nwrong. It seems plainly contrary to the statutory language,\nbut as is almost always the case when we decide whether to\ngrant emergency relief, I do not rule out the possibility that\nfurther briefing and argument might convince me that my\ncurrent view is unfounded. But with that caveat, I will pro-\nceed to discuss the statutory language.\n   The statutory provision in question reads as follows:\n       \u201cNo person acting under color of law shall . . . deny\n    the right of any individual to vote in any election be-\n    cause of an error or omission on any record or paper\n    related to any application, registration, or other act\n    requisite to voting, if such error or omission is not ma-\n    terial in determining whether such individual is quali-\n    fied under State law to vote in such election.\u201d\n    \u00a710101(a)(2)(B).\n   This provision has five elements: (1) the proscribed con-\nduct must be engaged in by a person who is \u201cacting under\ncolor of law\u201d; (2) it must have the effect of \u201cdeny[ing]\u201d an\nindividual \u201cthe right to vote\u201d; (3) this denial must be at-\ntributable to \u201can error or omission on [a] record or paper\u201d;\n(4) the \u201crecord or paper\u201d must be \u201crelated to [an] applica-\ntion, registration, or other act requisite to voting\u201d; and (5)\nthe error or omission must not be \u201cmaterial in determining\nwhether such individual is qualified under State law to vote\nin such election.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Third Circuit held that the failure to count mail-in\nballots that did not include the date on which they were\nfilled out constituted a violation of this provision, but the\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                     3\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nThird Circuit made little effort to explain how its interpre-\ntation can be reconciled with the language of the statute.\nIn my view, however, it appears that elements 2 and 5 are\nclearly not met.1\n   I will start with element 2. When a mail-in ballot is not\ncounted because it was not filled out correctly, the voter is\nnot denied \u201cthe right to vote.\u201d Rather, that individual\u2019s vote\nis not counted because he or she did not follow the rules for\ncasting a ballot. \u201cCasting a vote, whether by following the\ndirections for using a voting machine or completing a paper\nballot, requires compliance with certain rules.\u201d Brnovich v.\nDemocratic National Committee, 594 U. S. ___, ___ (2021)\n(slip op., at 16). A registered voter who does not follow the\nrules may be unable to cast a vote for any number of rea-\nsons. A voter may go to the polling place on the wrong day\nor after the polls have closed. A voter may go to the wrong\npolling place and may not have time to reach the right place\nbefore it is too late. A voter who casts a mail-in ballot may\nsend it to the wrong address. A State\u2019s refusal to count the\nvotes of these voters does not constitute a denial of \u201cthe\nright to vote.\u201d Even the most permissive voting rules must\ncontain some requirements, and the failure to follow those\nrules constitutes the forfeiture of the right to vote, not the\ndenial of that right.\n   Element 5 weighs even more heavily against the Third\nCircuit\u2019s interpretation. This element requires that the er-\nror or omission be \u201cmaterial in determining whether such\nindividual is qualified under State law to vote in such elec-\ntion.\u201d There is no reason why the requirements that must\nbe met in order to register (and thus be \u201cqualified\u201d) to vote\nshould be the same as the requirements that must be met\nin order to cast a ballot that will be counted. Indeed, it\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Elements 1 and 3 are satisfied, but for the reasons explained below,\n\nsee n. 2, infra, the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation is not consistent with\nthe most natural reading of element 4.\n\f4                     RITTER v. MIGLIORI\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwould be silly to think otherwise. Think of the previously\nmentioned hypothetical voters whose votes were not\ncounted because they did not follow the rules for casting a\nvote. None of the rules they violated\u2014rules setting the date\nof an election, the location of the voter\u2019s assigned polling\nplace, the address to which a mail-in ballot must be sent\u2014\nhas anything to do with the requirements that must be met\nin order to establish eligibility to vote, and it would be ab-\nsurd to judge the validity of voting rules based on whether\nthey are material to eligibility.\n   Under Pennsylvania law, a person is qualified to vote if\nhe or she is at least 18 years old on the day of the election,\nhas been a citizen of the State for at least one month, has\nlived in the relevant election district for at least 30 days,\nand is not imprisoned for a felony. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">25 Pa. Cons. Stat.\n\u00a71301</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002). Other requirements must be met in order for\na mail-in ballot to be counted. Among other things, a stat-\nute provides that a voter \u201cshall . . . fill out, date and sign\u201d a\ndeclaration printed on the outer security envelope in which\nthe actual ballot is sealed. S. 422, 2020 Gen. Assem., Reg.\nSess. (Pa.), codified at Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 25, \u00a73150.16(a)\n(emphasis added); see also Migliori v.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court\nhas held that the inclusion of the date on which the ballot\nwas filled out is mandatory and that undated ballots cannot\nbe counted, see In re Canvass of Absentee and Mail-in Bal-\nlots of Nov. 3, 2020 General Election, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">241 A. 3d 1058</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa.\n2020), but the Third Circuit held that this state-law rule is\npreempted by </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U. S. C. \u00a710101</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(2)(B) because the inclu-\nsion of a date is not material to the question whether a per-\nson is qualified to vote.\n   Can that possibly be correct? One may argue that the\ninclusion of a date does not serve any strong purpose and\nthat a voter\u2019s failure to date a ballot should not cause the\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                       5\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nballot to be disqualified. But \u00a710101(a)(2)(B) does not ad-\ndress that issue. It applies only to errors or omissions that\nare not material to the question whether a person is quali-\nfied to vote. It leaves it to the States to decide which voting\nrules should be mandatory.\n   The problem with the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation can\nbe illustrated by considering what would happen if it were\napplied to a mail-in voting rule that is indisputably im-\nportant, namely, the requirement that a mail-in ballot be\nsigned. Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 25, \u00a73150.16(a). Suppose a\nvoter did not personally sign his or her ballot but instead\ninstructed another person to complete the ballot and sign it\nusing the standard notation employed when a letter is\nsigned for someone else: \u201cp. p. John or Jane Doe.\u201d Or sup-\npose that a voter, for some reason, typed his or her name\ninstead of signing it. Those violations would be material in\ndetermining whether a ballot should be counted, but they\nwould not be \u201cmaterial in determining whether such indi-\nvidual is qualified under State law to vote in such election.\u201d\nTherefore, under the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation, a ballot\nsigned by a third party and a ballot with a typed name ra-\nther than a signature would have to be counted. It seems\nmost unlikely that this is what </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U. S. C. \u00a710101</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(2)(B)\nmeans.2\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 In light of what I have written about elements 2 and 5, it is unlikely\n\nthat element 4 must be addressed, but for the sake of completeness, I\nwill add that the language of that provision must be given a strained\nmeaning in order to make it applicable to the validity of a rule about\nfilling out a mail-in ballot. Element 4 demands that a \u201crecord or paper\u201d\nmust be \u201crelated to [an] application, registration, or other act requisite\nto voting.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U. S. C. \u00a710101</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(2)(B). A mail-in ballot is a \u201crecord or\npaper,\u201d and it does not appear to be related in any direct sense to any\n\u201capplication\u201d or \u201cregistration,\u201d so the question is whether it is \u201crelated\nto\u201d some \u201cother act requisite to voting.\u201d But the casting of a ballot con-\nstitutes the act of voting. Indeed, the statute specifies that \u201cthe word\n\u2018vote\u2019 includes all action necessary to make a vote effective including . . .\n\f6                        RITTER v.

BOULE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 21\u2013147.      Argued March 2, 2022\u2014Decided June 8, 2022\nRespondent Robert Boule owns a bed-and-breakfast\u2014the Smuggler\u2019s\n  Inn\u2014in Blaine, Washington. The inn abuts the international border\n  between Canada and the United States. Boule at times helped federal\n  agents identify and apprehend persons engaged in unlawful cross-bor-\n  der activity on or near his property. But Boule also would provide\n  transportation and lodging to illegal border crossers. Often, Boule\n  would agree to help illegal border crossers enter or exit the United\n  States, only to later call federal agents to report the unlawful activity.\n    In 2014, Boule informed petitioner Erik Egbert, a U. S. Border Pa-\n  trol agent, that a Turkish national, arriving in Seattle by way of New\n  York, had scheduled transportation to Smuggler\u2019s Inn. When Agent\n  Egbert observed one of Boule\u2019s vehicles returning to the inn, he sus-\n  pected that the Turkish national was a passenger and followed the ve-\n  hicle to the inn. On Boule\u2019s account, Boule asked Egbert to leave, but\n  Egbert refused, became violent, and threw Boule first against the ve-\n  hicle and then to the ground. Egbert then checked the immigration\n  paperwork for Boule\u2019s guest and left after finding everything in order.\n  The Turkish guest unlawfully entered Canada later that evening.\n    Boule filed a grievance with Agent Egbert\u2019s supervisors and an ad-\n  ministrative claim with Border Patrol pursuant to the Federal Tort\n  Claims Act (FTCA). Egbert allegedly retaliated against Boule by re-\n  porting Boule\u2019s \u201cSMUGLER\u201d license plate to the Washington Depart-\n  ment of Licensing for referencing illegal activity, and by contacting the\n  Internal Revenue Service and prompting an audit of Boule\u2019s tax re-\n  turns. Boule\u2019s FTCA claim was ultimately denied, and Border Patrol\n  took no action against Egbert for his use of force or alleged acts of re-\n  taliation. Boule then sued Egbert in Federal District Court, alleging\n  a Fourth Amendment violation for excessive use of force and a First\n\f2                          EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Amendment violation for unlawful retaliation. Invoking Bivens v. Six\n    Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, Boule asked the Dis-\n    trict Court to recognize a damages action for each alleged constitu-\n    tional violation. The District Court declined to extend Bivens as re-\n    quested, but the Court of Appeals reversed.\nHeld: Bivens does not extend to create causes of action for Boule\u2019s Fourth\n Amendment excessive-force claim and First Amendment retaliation\n claim. Pp. 5\u201317.\n    (a) In Bivens, the Court held that it had authority to create a dam-\n ages action against federal agents for violating the plaintiff\u2019s Fourth\n Amendment rights. Over the next decade, the Court also fashioned\n new causes of action under the Fifth Amendment, see Davis v. Pass-\n man, 442 U. S. 228, and the Eighth Amendment, see Carlson v. Green,\n 446 U. S. 14. Since then, however, the Court has come \u201cto appreciate\n more fully the tension between\u201d judicially created causes of action and\n \u201cthe Constitution\u2019s separation of legislative and judicial power,\u201d Her-\n n\u00e1ndez v. Mesa, 589 U. S. ___, ___, and has declined 11 times to imply\n a similar cause of action for other alleged constitutional violations, see,\n e.g., Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S. 296; Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367.\n Rather than dispense with Bivens, the Court now emphasizes that rec-\n ognizing a Bivens cause of action is \u201ca disfavored judicial activity.\u201d\n Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U. S. ___, ___.\n    The analysis of a proposed Bivens claim proceeds in two steps: A\n court asks first whether the case presents \u201ca new Bivens context\u201d\u2014i.e.,\n is it \u201cmeaningfully different from the three cases in which the Court\n has implied a damages action,\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, and, second,\n even if so, do \u201cspecial factors\u201d indicate that the Judiciary is at least\n arguably less equipped than Congress to \u201cweigh the costs and benefits\n of allowing a damages action to proceed.\u201d Id., at ___. This two-step\n inquiry often resolves to a single question: whether there is any reason\n to think that Congress might be better equipped to create a damages\n remedy. Further, under the Court\u2019s precedents, a court may not fash-\n ion a Bivens remedy if Congress already has provided, or has author-\n ized the Executive to provide, \u201can alternative remedial structure.\u201d\n Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___. Pp. 5\u20138.\n    (b) The Court of Appeals conceded that Boule\u2019s Fourth Amendment\n claim presented a new Bivens context, but its conclusion that there\n was no reason to hesitate before recognizing a cause of action against\n Agent Egbert was incorrect for two independent reasons. Pp. 9\u201313.\n       (1) First, the \u201crisk of undermining border security provides reason\n to hesitate before extending Bivens into this field.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, 589\n U. S., at ___. In Hern\u00e1ndez, the Court declined to create a damages\n remedy for an excessive-force claim against a Border Patrol agent be-\n cause \u201cregulating the conduct of agents at the border unquestionably\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nhas national security implications.\u201d Id., at ___. That reasoning applies\nwith full force here. The Court of Appeals disagreed because it viewed\nBoule\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim as akin to a \u201cconventional\u201d exces-\nsive-force claim, as in Bivens, and less like the cross-border shooting\nin Hern\u00e1ndez. But that does not bear on the relevant point: Permitting\nsuit against a Border Patrol agent presents national security concerns\nthat foreclose Bivens relief. Further, the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis\nbetrays the pitfalls of applying the special-factors analysis at too gran-\nular a level. A court should not inquire whether Bivens relief is appro-\npriate in light of the balance of circumstances in the \u201cparticular case.\u201d\nUnited States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669, 683. Rather, it should ask\n\u201c[m]ore broadly\u201d whether there is any reason to think that \u201cjudicial\nintrusion\u201d into a given field might be \u201charmful\u201d or \u201cinappropriate,\u201d id.,\nat 681. The proper inquiry here is whether a court is competent to\nauthorize a damages action not just against Agent Egbert, but against\nBorder Patrol agents generally. The answer is no. Pp. 9\u201312.\n      (2) Second, Congress has provided alternative remedies for ag-\ngrieved parties in Boule\u2019s position that independently foreclose a\nBivens action here. By regulation, Border Patrol must investigate\n\u201c[a]lleged violations\u201d and accept grievances from \u201c[a]ny persons.\u201d 8\nCFR \u00a7\u00a7287.10(a)\u2013(b). Boule claims that this regulatory grievance pro-\ncedure was inadequate, but this Court has never held that a Bivens\nalternative must afford rights such as judicial review of an adverse\ndetermination. Bivens \u201cis concerned solely with deterring the uncon-\nstitutional acts of individual officers.\u201d Correctional Services Corp. v.\nMalesko, 534 U. S. 61, 71. And, regardless, the question whether a\ngiven remedy is adequate is a legislative determination. As in Her-\nn\u00e1ndez, this Court has no warrant to doubt that the consideration of\nBoule\u2019s grievance secured adequate deterrence and afforded Boule an\nalternative remedy. See 589 U. S., at ___. Pp. 12\u201313.\n   (c) There is no Bivens cause of action for Boule\u2019s First Amendment\nretaliation claim. That claim presents a new Bivens context, and there\nare many reasons to think that Congress is better suited to authorize\na damages remedy. Extending Bivens to alleged First Amendment vi-\nolations would pose an acute \u201crisk that fear of personal monetary lia-\nbility and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit officials in the dis-\ncharge of their duties.\u201d Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 638. In\nlight of these costs, \u201cCongress is in a better position to decide whether\nor not the public interest would be served\u201d by imposing a damages ac-\ntion. Bush, 462 U. S., at 389. The Court of Appeals\u2019 reasons for ex-\ntending Bivens in this context\u2014that retaliation claims are \u201cwell-estab-\nlished\u201d and that Boule alleges that Agent Egbert \u201cwas not carrying out\nofficial duties\u201d when the retaliation occurred\u2014lack merit. Also lacking\n\f4                           EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    merit is Boule\u2019s claim that this Court identified a Bivens cause of ac-\n    tion under allegedly similar circumstances in Passman. Even assum-\n    ing factual parallels, Passman carries little weight because it predates\n    the Court\u2019s current approach to implied causes of action. A plaintiff\n    cannot justify a Bivens extension based on \u201cparallel circumstances\u201d\n    with Bivens, Passman, or Carlson\u2014the three cases in which the Court\n    has implied a damages action\u2014unless the plaintiff also satisfies the\n    prevailing \u201canalytic framework\u201d prescribed by the last four decades of\n    intervening case law.

ROBERT BOULE\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                                   [June 8, 2022]\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403\nU. S. 388 (1971), this Court authorized a damages action\nagainst federal officials for alleged violations of the Fourth\nAmendment. Over the past 42 years, however, we have de-\nclined 11 times to imply a similar cause of action for other\nalleged constitutional violations. See Chappell v. Wallace,\n462 U. S. 296 (1983); Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367 (1983);\nUnited States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669 (1987); Schweiker v.\nChilicky, 487 U. S. 412 (1988); FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471\n(1994); Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61\n(2001); Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U. S. 537 (2007); Hui v. Cas-\ntaneda, 559 U. S. 799 (2010); Minneci v. Pollard, 565 U. S.\n118 (2012); Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U. S. ___ (2017); Hern\u00e1n-\ndez v. Mesa, 589 U. S. ___ (2020). Nevertheless, the Court\nof Appeals permitted not one, but two constitutional dam-\nages actions to proceed against a U. S. Border Patrol agent:\na Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim and a First\nAmendment retaliation claim. Because our cases have\nmade clear that, in all but the most unusual circumstances,\nprescribing a cause of action is a job for Congress, not the\ncourts, we reverse.\n\f2                     EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n  Blaine, Washington, is the last town in the United States\nalong U. S. Interstate Highway 5 before reaching the Cana-\ndian border. Respondent Robert Boule is a longtime Blaine\nresident. The rear of his property abuts the Canadian bor-\nder at \u201c0 Avenue,\u201d a Canadian street. Boule\u2019s property line\nactually extends five feet into Canada. Several years ago,\nBoule placed a line of small stones on his property to mark\nthe international boundary. As shown below, any person\ncould easily enter the United States or Canada through or\nnear Boule\u2019s property. See App. 100.\n\n\n\n\n  Boule markets his home as a bed-and-breakfast aptly\nnamed \u201cSmuggler\u2019s Inn.\u201d The area surrounding the Inn \u201cis\na hotspot for cross-border smuggling of people, drugs, illicit\nmoney, and items of significance to criminal organizations.\u201d\nId., at 91. \u201cOn numerous occasions,\u201d U. S. Border Patrol\nagents \u201chave observed persons come south across the bor-\nder and walk into Smuggler\u2019s Inn through the back door.\u201d\nId., at 101. Federal agents also have seized from the Inn\nshipments of cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, and\nother narcotics. For a time, Boule served as a confidential\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninformant who would help federal agents identify and ap-\nprehend persons engaged in unlawful cross-border activity\non or near his property. Boule claims that the Government\nhas paid him upwards of $60,000 for his services.\n   Ever the entrepreneur, Boule saw his relationship with\nBorder Patrol as a business opportunity. Boule would host\npersons who unlawfully entered the United States as\n\u201cguests\u201d at the Inn and offer to drive them to Seattle or else-\nwhere. He also would pick up Canada-bound guests\nthroughout the State and drive them north to his property\nalong the border. Either way, Boule would charge $100\u2013\n$150 per hour for his shuttle service and require guests to\npay for a night of lodging even if they never intended to stay\nat the Inn. Meanwhile, Boule would inform federal law en-\nforcement if he was scheduled to lodge or transport persons\nof interest. In short order, Border Patrol agents would ar-\nrive to arrest the guests, often within a few blocks of the\nInn. Boule would decline to offer his erstwhile customers a\nrefund. In his view, this practice was \u201cnothing any different\nthan [the] normal policies of any hotel/motel.\u201d Id., at 120.1\n   In light of Boule\u2019s business model, local Border Patrol\nagents, including petitioner Erik Egbert, were well ac-\nquainted with Smuggler\u2019s Inn and the criminal activity that\nattended it. On March 20, 2014, Boule informed Agent Eg-\nbert that a Turkish national, arriving in Seattle by way of\nNew York, had scheduled transportation to Smuggler\u2019s Inn\nlater that day. Agent Egbert grew suspicious, as he could\nthink of \u201cno legitimate reason a person would travel from\nTurkey to stay at a rundown bed-and-breakfast on the bor-\nder in Blaine.\u201d Id., at 104. The photograph below displays\nthe amenities for which Boule\u2019s Turkish guest would have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Notwithstanding his defense of the Inn\u2019s policies, Boule was recently\n\nconvicted in Canadian court for engaging in human trafficking. In De-\ncember 2021, he pleaded guilty to trafficking 11 Afghanis and Syrians\ninto Canada. He billed each foreign national between $200 and $700 for\nthe trip. See Regina v. Boule, 2021 BCSC 2561, \u00b6\u00b67\u201311.\n\f4                    EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntraveled more than 7,500 miles. See id., at 102.\n\n\n\n\n   Later that afternoon, Agent Egbert observed one of\nBoule\u2019s vehicles\u2014a black SUV with the license plate\n\u201cSMUGLER\u201d\u2014returning to the Inn. Agent Egbert sus-\npected that Boule\u2019s Turkish guest was a passenger and fol-\nlowed the SUV into the driveway so he could check the\nguest\u2019s immigration status. On Boule\u2019s account, the situa-\ntion escalated from there. Boule instructed Agent Egbert\nto leave his property, but Agent Egbert declined. Instead,\nBoule claims, Agent Egbert lifted him off the ground and\nthrew him against the SUV. After Boule collected himself,\nAgent Egbert allegedly threw him to the ground. Agent Eg-\nbert then checked the guest\u2019s immigration paperwork, con-\ncluded that everything was in order, and left. Later that\nevening, Boule\u2019s Turkish guest unlawfully entered Canada\nfrom Smuggler\u2019s Inn.\n   Boule lodged a grievance with Agent Egbert\u2019s supervi-\nsors, alleging that Agent Egbert had used excessive force\nand caused him physical injury. Boule also filed an admin-\nistrative claim with Border Patrol pursuant to the Federal\nTort Claims Act (FTCA). See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72675(a). Accord-\ning to Boule, Agent Egbert retaliated against him while\n\f                   Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)              5\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthose claims were pending by reporting Boule\u2019s\n\u201cSMUGLER\u201d license plate to the Washington Department\nof Licensing for referencing illegal conduct, and by contact-\ning the Internal Revenue Service and prompting an audit\nof Boule\u2019s tax returns. Ultimately, Boule\u2019s FTCA claim was\ndenied and, after a year-long investigation, Border Patrol\ntook no action against Agent Egbert for his alleged use of\nforce or acts of retaliation. Thereafter, Agent Egbert con-\ntinued to serve as an active-duty Border Patrol agent.\n   In January 2017, Boule sued Agent Egbert in his individ-\nual capacity in Federal District Court, alleging a Fourth\nAmendment violation for excessive use of force and a First\nAmendment violation for unlawful retaliation. Boule in-\nvoked Bivens and asked the District Court to recognize a\ndamages action for each alleged constitutional violation.\nThe District Court declined to extend a Bivens remedy to\nBoule\u2019s claims and entered judgment for Agent Egbert. The\nCourt of Appeals reversed. See 998 F. 3d 370, 385 (CA9\n2021). Twelve judges dissented from the denial of rehear-\ning en banc. See id., at 373 (Bumatay, J., dissenting); id.,\nat 384 (Owens, J., dissenting); ibid. (Bress, J., dissenting).\n   We granted certiorari. 595 U. S. ___ (2021).\n                               II\n   In Bivens, the Court held that it had authority to create\n\u201ca cause of action under the Fourth Amendment\u201d against\nfederal agents who allegedly manacled the plaintiff and\nthreatened his family while arresting him for narcotics vio-\nlations. 403 U. S., at 397. Although \u201cthe Fourth Amend-\nment does not in so many words provide for its enforcement\nby an award of money damages,\u201d id., at 396, the Court \u201cheld\nthat it could authorize a remedy under general principles of\nfederal jurisdiction,\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7)\n(citing Bivens, 403 U. S., at 392). Over the following decade,\nthe Court twice again fashioned new causes of action under\nthe Constitution\u2014first, for a former congressional staffer\u2019s\n\f6                     EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nFifth Amendment sex-discrimination claim, see Davis v.\nPassman, 442 U. S. 228 (1979); and second, for a federal\nprisoner\u2019s inadequate-care claim under the Eighth Amend-\nment, see Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14 (1980).\n   Since these cases, the Court has not implied additional\ncauses of action under the Constitution. Now long past \u201cthe\nheady days in which this Court assumed common-law pow-\ners to create causes of action,\u201d Malesko, 534 U. S., at 75\n(Scalia, J., concurring), we have come \u201cto appreciate more\nfully the tension between\u201d judicially created causes of ac-\ntion and \u201cthe Constitution\u2019s separation of legislative and ju-\ndicial power,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).\nAt bottom, creating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor. Courts engaged in that unenviable task must eval-\nuate a \u201crange of policy considerations . . . at least as broad\nas the range . . . a legislature would consider.\u201d Bivens, 403\nU. S., at 407 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment); see also\npost, at 2 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment). Those\nfactors include \u201ceconomic and governmental concerns,\u201d \u201cad-\nministrative costs,\u201d and the \u201cimpact on governmental oper-\nations systemwide.\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op.,\nat 10, 13). Unsurprisingly, Congress is \u201cfar more competent\nthan the Judiciary\u201d to weigh such policy considerations.\nSchweiker, 487 U. S., at 423. And the Judiciary\u2019s authority\nto do so at all is, at best, uncertain. See, e.g., Hern\u00e1ndez,\n589 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).\n   Nonetheless, rather than dispense with Bivens alto-\ngether, we have emphasized that recognizing a cause of ac-\ntion under Bivens is \u201ca disfavored judicial activity.\u201d Ziglar,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). When asked to imply a\nBivens action, \u201cour watchword is caution.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6). \u201c[I]f there are sound reasons to think Congress\nmight doubt the efficacy or necessity of a damages rem-\nedy[,] the courts must refrain from creating [it].\u201d Ziglar,\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). \u201c[E]ven a single sound\nreason to defer to Congress\u201d is enough to require a court to\nrefrain from creating such a remedy. Nestl\u00e9 USA, Inc. v.\nDoe, 593 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at\n6). Put another way, \u201cthe most important question is who\nshould decide whether to provide for a damages remedy,\nCongress or the courts?\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 19\u201320) (internal quotation marks omitted). If\nthere is a rational reason to think that the answer is \u201cCon-\ngress\u201d\u2014as it will be in most every case, see Ziglar, 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12)\u2014no Bivens action may lie. Our\ncases instruct that, absent utmost deference to Congress\u2019\npreeminent authority in this area, the courts \u201carrogat[e]\nlegislative power.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n5).\n   To inform a court\u2019s analysis of a proposed Bivens claim,\nour cases have framed the inquiry as proceeding in two\nsteps. See Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).\nFirst, we ask whether the case presents \u201ca new Bivens con-\ntext\u201d\u2014i.e., is it \u201cmeaningful[ly]\u201d different from the three\ncases in which the Court has implied a damages action.\nZiglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). Second, if a claim\narises in a new context, a Bivens remedy is unavailable if\nthere are \u201cspecial factors\u201d indicating that the Judiciary is\nat least arguably less equipped than Congress to \u201cweigh the\ncosts and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed.\u201d\nZiglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). If there is even a single \u201creason to pause\nbefore applying Bivens in a new context,\u201d a court may not\nrecognize a Bivens remedy. Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 7).\n   While our cases describe two steps, those steps often re-\nsolve to a single question: whether there is any reason to\nthink that Congress might be better equipped to create a\ndamages remedy. For example, we have explained that a\nnew context arises when there are \u201cpotential special factors\n\f8                         EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat previous Bivens cases did not consider.\u201d Ziglar, 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). And we have identified several\nexamples of new contexts\u2014e.g., a case that involves a \u201cnew\ncategory of defendants,\u201d Malesko, 534 U. S., at 68; see also\nZiglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11)\u2014largely because\nthey represent situations in which a court is not undoubt-\nedly better positioned than Congress to create a damages\naction. We have never offered an \u201cexhaustive\u201d accounting\nof such scenarios, however, because no court could forecast\nevery factor that might \u201ccounse[l] hesitation.\u201d Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 16). Even in a particular case, a court likely\ncannot predict the \u201csystemwide\u201d consequences of recogniz-\ning a cause of action under Bivens. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 13). That uncertainty alone is a special factor\nthat forecloses relief. See Hern\u00e1ndez v. Mesa, 885 F. 3d\n811, 818 (CA5 2018) (en banc) (\u201cThe newness of this \u2018new\ncontext\u2019 should alone require dismissal\u201d).\n   Finally, our cases hold that a court may not fashion a\nBivens remedy if Congress already has provided, or has au-\nthorized the Executive to provide, \u201can alternative remedial\nstructure.\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14); see also\nSchweicker, 487 U. S., at 425. If there are alternative re-\nmedial structures in place, \u201cthat alone,\u201d like any special fac-\ntor, is reason enough to \u201climit the power of the Judiciary to\ninfer a new Bivens cause of action.\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 14).2 Importantly, the relevant question is not\nwhether a Bivens action would \u201cdisrup[t]\u201d a remedial\nscheme, Schweicker, 487 U. S., at 426, or whether the court\n\u201cshould provide for a wrong that would otherwise go unre-\ndressed,\u201d Bush, 462 U. S., at 388. Nor does it matter that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Congress also may preclude a claim under Bivens v. Six Unknown\n\nFed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), against federal officers if it\naffirmatively forecloses one. \u201cEven in circumstances in which a Bivens\nremedy is generally available, an action under Bivens will be defeated if\nthe defendant is immune from suit,\u201d Hui v. Castaneda, 559 U. S. 799,\n807 (2010), and Congress may grant such immunity as it sees fit.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cexisting remedies do not provide complete relief.\u201d Ibid.\nRather, the court must ask only whether it, rather than the\npolitical branches, is better equipped to decide whether ex-\nisting remedies \u201cshould be augmented by the creation of a\nnew judicial remedy.\u201d Ibid; see also id., at 380 (\u201cthe ques-\ntion [is] who should decide\u201d).\n                           III\n  Applying the foregoing principles, the Court of Appeals\nplainly erred when it created causes of action for Boule\u2019s\nFourth Amendment excessive-force claim and First Amend-\nment retaliation claim.\n                              A\n  The Court of Appeals conceded that Boule\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment claim presented a new context for Bivens pur-\nposes, yet it concluded there was no reason to hesitate be-\nfore recognizing a cause of action against Agent Egbert. See\n998 F. 3d, at 387. That conclusion was incorrect for two in-\ndependent reasons: Congress is better positioned to create\nremedies in the border-security context, and the Govern-\nment already has provided alternative remedies that pro-\ntect plaintiffs like Boule. We address each in turn.\n                                1\n  In Hern\u00e1ndez, we declined to create a damages remedy\nfor an excessive-force claim against a Border Patrol agent\nwho shot and killed a 15-year-old Mexican national across\nthe border in Mexico. See 589 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n1\u20132). We did not recognize a Bivens action there because\n\u201cregulating the conduct of agents at the border unquestion-\nably has national security implications,\u201d and the \u201crisk of\nundermining border security provides reason to hesitate be-\nfore extending Bivens into this field.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14). This reasoning applies here with full\nforce. During the alleged altercation with Boule, Agent Eg-\n\f10                    EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbert was carrying out Border Patrol\u2019s mandate to \u201cinter-\ndic[t] persons attempting to illegally enter or exit the\nUnited States or goods being illegally imported into or ex-\nported from the United States.\u201d 6 U. S. C. \u00a7211(e)(3)(A).\nBecause \u201c[m]atters intimately related to foreign policy and\nnational security are rarely proper subjects for judicial in-\ntervention,\u201d Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 292 (1981), we re-\naffirm that a Bivens cause of action may not lie where, as\nhere, national security is at issue.\n    The Court of Appeals thought otherwise. In its view,\nBoule\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim is \u201cconventional,\u201d 998\nF. 3d, at 387; see also post, at 8, 12 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concur-\nring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (same),\nand, though it arises in a new context, this Court has not\n\u201c \u2018cast doubt\u2019 \u201d on extending Bivens within the \u201c \u2018common and\nrecurrent sphere of law enforcement\u2019 \u201d in which it arose, 998\nF. 3d, at 389 (quoting Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n11)). While Bivens and this case do involve similar allega-\ntions of excessive force and thus arguably present \u201calmost\nparallel circumstances\u201d or a similar \u201cmechanism of injury,\u201d\nZiglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15), these superficial\nsimilarities are not enough to support the judicial creation\nof a cause of action. The special-factors inquiry\u2014which\nBivens never meaningfully undertook, see Stanley, 483\nU. S., at 678\u2014shows here, no less than in Hern\u00e1ndez, that\nthe Judiciary is not undoubtedly better positioned than\nCongress to authorize a damages action in this national-se-\ncurity context. That this case does not involve a cross-bor-\nder shooting, as in Hern\u00e1ndez, but rather a more \u201cconven-\ntional\u201d excessive-force claim, as in Bivens, does not bear on\nthe relevant point. Either way, the Judiciary is compara-\ntively ill suited to decide whether a damages remedy\nagainst any Border Patrol agent is appropriate.\n    The Court of Appeals downplayed the national-security\nrisk from imposing Bivens liability because Agent Egbert\nwas not \u201cliterally \u2018at the border,\u2019 \u201d and Boule\u2019s guest already\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhad cleared customs in New York. 998 F. 3d, at 388; see\nalso post, at 11\u201312, 18 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (same).\nThe court also found that Boule had a weightier interest in\nBivens relief than the parents of the deceased Mexican\nteenager in Hern\u00e1ndez, because Boule \u201cis a United States\ncitizen, complaining of harm suffered on his own property\nin the United States.\u201d 998 F. 3d, at 388; see also post, at 12,\n18 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (same). Finding that \u201cany\ncosts imposed by allowing a Bivens claim to proceed are out-\nweighed by compelling interests in favor of protecting\nUnited States citizens on their own property in the United\nStates,\u201d the court extended Bivens to Boule\u2019s case. 998\nF. 3d, at 389.\n   This analysis is deeply flawed. The Bivens inquiry does\nnot invite federal courts to independently assess the costs\nand benefits of implying a cause of action. A court faces\nonly one question: whether there is any rational reason\n(even one) to think that Congress is better suited to \u201cweigh\nthe costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to pro-\nceed.\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Thus, a\ncourt should not inquire, as the Court of Appeals did here,\nwhether Bivens relief is appropriate in light of the balance\nof circumstances in the \u201cparticular case.\u201d Stanley, 483\nU. S., at 683. A court inevitably will \u201cimpai[r]\u201d governmen-\ntal interests, and thereby frustrate Congress\u2019 policymaking\nrole, if it applies the \u201c \u2018special factors\u2019 analysis\u201d at such a\nnarrow \u201cleve[l] of generality.\u201d Id., at 681. Rather, under\nthe proper approach, a court must ask \u201c[m]ore broadly\u201d if\nthere is any reason to think that \u201cjudicial intrusion\u201d into a\ngiven field might be \u201charmful\u201d or \u201cinappropriate.\u201d Ibid. If\nso, or even if there is the \u201cpotential\u201d for such consequences,\na court cannot afford a plaintiff a Bivens remedy. Ziglar,\n582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 16, 25) (emphasis added).\nAs in Hern\u00e1ndez, then, we ask here whether a court is com-\npetent to authorize a damages action not just against Agent\n\f12                    EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nEgbert but against Border Patrol agents generally. The an-\nswer, plainly, is no. See Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 14) (refusing to extend Bivens into the \u201cfield\u201d of \u201cbor-\nder security\u201d).\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis betrays the pitfalls of ap-\nplying the special-factors analysis at too granular a level.\nThe court rested on three irrelevant distinctions from Her-\nn\u00e1ndez. First, Agent Egbert was several feet from (rather\nthan straddling) the border, but cross-border security is ob-\nviously implicated in either event. Second, Boule\u2019s guest\narrived in Seattle from New York rather than abroad, but\nan alien\u2019s port of entry does not make him less likely to be\na national-security threat. And third, Agent Egbert inves-\ntigated immigration violations on our side of the border, not\nCanada\u2019s, but immigration investigations in this country\nare perhaps more likely to impact the national security of\nthe United States. In short, the Court of Appeals offered no\nplausible basis to permit a Fourth Amendment Bivens\nclaim against Agent Egbert to proceed.\n                               2\n   Second, Congress has provided alternative remedies for\naggrieved parties in Boule\u2019s position that independently\nforeclose a Bivens action here. In Hern\u00e1ndez, we declined\nto authorize a Bivens remedy, in part, because the Execu-\ntive Branch already had investigated alleged misconduct by\nthe defendant Border Patrol agent. See 589 U. S., at ___\u2013\n___, ___ (slip op., at 9\u201310, 14). In Malesko, we explained\nthat Bivens relief was unavailable because federal prison-\ners could, among other options, file grievances through an\n\u201cAdministrative Remedy Program.\u201d 534 U. S., at 74. Both\nkinds of remedies are available here. The U. S. Border Pa-\ntrol is statutorily obligated to \u201ccontrol, direc[t], and super-\nvis[e] . . . all employees.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71103(a)(2). And, by\nregulation, Border Patrol must investigate \u201c[a]lleged viola-\ntions of the standards for enforcement activities\u201d and accept\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                       13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ngrievances from \u201c[a]ny persons wishing to lodge a com-\nplaint.\u201d 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7287.10(a)\u2013(b). As noted, Boule took ad-\nvantage of this grievance procedure, prompting a year-long\ninternal investigation into Agent Egbert\u2019s conduct. See su-\npra, at 4\u20135.\n   Boule nonetheless contends that Border Patrol\u2019s griev-\nance process is inadequate because he is not entitled to par-\nticipate and has no right to judicial review of an adverse\ndetermination.3 But we have never held that a Bivens al-\nternative must afford rights to participation or appeal.\nThat is so because Bivens \u201cis concerned solely with deter-\nring the unconstitutional acts of individual officers\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nthe focus is whether the Government has put in place safe-\nguards to \u201cpreven[t]\u201d constitutional violations \u201cfrom recur-\nring.\u201d Malesko, 534 U. S., at 71, 74; see also Meyer, 510\nU. S., at 485. And, again, the question whether a given\nremedy is adequate is a legislative determination that must\nbe left to Congress, not the federal courts. So long as Con-\ngress or the Executive has created a remedial process that\nit finds sufficient to secure an adequate level of deterrence,\nthe courts cannot second-guess that calibration by superim-\nposing a Bivens remedy. That is true even if a court inde-\npendently concludes that the Government\u2019s procedures are\n\u201cnot as effective as an individual damages remedy.\u201d Bush,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Boule also argues that Agent Egbert forfeited any argument about\n\nBorder Patrol\u2019s grievance process because he did not raise the issue in\nthe Court of Appeals. We disagree. Because recognizing a Bivens cause\nof action \u201cis an extraordinary act that places great stress on the separa-\ntion of powers,\u201d Nestl\u00e9 USA, Inc. v. Doe, 593 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (plural-\nity opinion) (slip op., at 7), we have \u201ca concomitant responsibility\u201d to eval-\nuate any grounds that counsel against Bivens relief, Oliva v. Nivar, 973\nF. 3d 438, 443, n. 2 (CA5 2020); see also Elhady v. Unidentified CBP\nAgents, 18 F. 4th 880, 884 (CA6 2021). And, in any event, Agent Egbert\nhas consistently claimed that alternative remedies foreclose applying\nBivens in this case. Thus, under our precedents, he is \u201cnot limited to the\nprecise arguments [he] made below.\u201d Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519,\n534 (1992).\n\f14                    EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n462 U. S., at 372. Thus here, as in Hern\u00e1ndez, we have no\nwarrant to doubt that the consideration of Boule\u2019s grievance\nagainst Agent Egbert secured adequate deterrence and af-\nforded Boule an alternative remedy. See 589 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 10).\n                               B\n   We also conclude that there is no Bivens cause of action\nfor Boule\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim. While we\nhave assumed that such a damages action might be availa-\nble, see, e.g., Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250, 252 (2006),\n\u201c[w]e have never held that Bivens extends to First Amend-\nment claims,\u201d Reichle v. Howards, 566 U. S. 658, 663, n. 4\n(2012). Because a new context arises when there is a new\n\u201cconstitutional right at issue,\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 16), the Court of Appeals correctly held that Boule\u2019s\nFirst Amendment claim presents a new Bivens context. See\n998 F. 3d, at 390. Now presented with the question\nwhether to extend Bivens to this context, we hold that there\nis no Bivens action for First Amendment retaliation. There\nare many reasons to think that Congress, not the courts, is\nbetter suited to authorize such a damages remedy.\n   Recognizing any new Bivens action \u201centail[s] substantial\nsocial costs, including the risk that fear of personal mone-\ntary liability and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit of-\nficials in the discharge of their duties.\u201d Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U. S. 635, 638 (1987). Extending Bivens to\nalleged First Amendment violations would pose an acute\nrisk of increasing such costs. A plaintiff can turn practically\nany adverse action into grounds for a retaliation claim.\nAnd, \u201c[b]ecause an official\u2019s state of mind is easy to allege\nand hard to disprove, insubstantial claims that turn on [re-\ntaliatory] intent may be less amenable to summary disposi-\ntion.\u201d Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 584\u2013585\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even a frivolous\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Bartlett, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip\nop., at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   \u201c[U]ndoubtedly,\u201d then, the \u201cprospect of personal liability\u201d\nunder the First Amendment would lead \u201cto new difficulties\nand expense.\u201d Schweiker, 487 U. S., at 425. Federal em-\nployees \u201cface[d with] the added risk of personal liability for\ndecisions that they believe to be a correct response to im-\nproper [activity] would be deterred from\u201d carrying out their\nduties. Bush, 462 U. S., at 389. We are therefore \u201ccon-\nvinced\u201d that, in light of these costs, \u201cCongress is in a better\nposition to decide whether or not the public interest would\nbe served\u201d by imposing a damages action. Id., at 390.\n   The Court of Appeals nonetheless extended Bivens to the\nFirst Amendment because, in its view, retaliation claims\nare \u201cwell-established,\u201d and Boule alleges that Agent Egbert\n\u201cwas not carrying out official duties\u201d when he retaliated\nagainst him. 998 F. 3d, at 391. Neither rationale has merit.\nFirst, just because plaintiffs often plead unlawful retalia-\ntion to establish a First Amendment violation is not a rea-\nson to afford them a cause of action to sue federal officers\nfor money damages. If anything, that retaliation claims are\ncommon, and therefore more likely to impose \u201ca significant\nexpansion of Government liability,\u201d Meyer, 510 U. S., at\n486, counsels against permitting Bivens relief.\n   Second, the Court of Appeals\u2019 scope-of-duty observation\ndoes not meaningfully limit the number of potential Bivens\nclaims or otherwise undermine the reasons for hesitation\nstated above. It is easy to allege that federal employees\nacted beyond the scope of their authority when claiming a\nconstitutional violation. And, regardless, granting Bivens\nrelief because a federal agent supposedly did not act pursu-\nant to his law-enforcement mission \u201cmisses the point.\u201d Her-\nn\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). \u201cThe question is\nnot whether national security,\u201d or some other governmental\n\f16                    EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterest, actually \u201crequires [the defendant\u2019s] conduct.\u201d Ibid.\nInstead, we \u201cask whether the Judiciary should alter the\nframework established by the political branches for ad-\ndressing\u201d any such conduct that allegedly violates the Con-\nstitution. Ibid. With respect to that question, the foregoing\ndiscussion shows that the Judiciary is ill equipped to alter\nthat framework generally, and especially so when it comes\nto First Amendment claims.\n  Boule responds that any hesitation is unwarranted be-\ncause this Court in Passman already identified a Bivens\ncause of action under allegedly similar circumstances.\nThere, the Court permitted a congressional staffer to sue a\ncongressman for sex discrimination under the Fifth Amend-\nment. See 442 U. S., at 231. In Boule\u2019s view, Passman, like\nthis case, permitted a damages action to proceed even\nthough it required the factfinder to probe a federal official\u2019s\nmotives for taking an adverse action against the plaintiff.\n  Even assuming the factual parallels are as close as Boule\nclaims, Passman carries little weight because it predates\nour current approach to implied causes of action and di-\nverges from the prevailing framework in three important\nways. First, the Passman Court concluded that a Bivens\naction must be available if there is \u201cno effective means other\nthan the judiciary to vindicate\u201d the purported Fifth Amend-\nment right. 442 U. S., at 243; see also Carlson, 446 U. S.,\nat 18\u201319 (Congress can foreclose Bivens relief by\n\u201cprovid[ing] an alternative remedy which it explicitly de-\nclared to be a substitute for recovery directly under the Con-\nstitution and viewed as equally effective\u201d). Since then, how-\never, we have explained that the absence of relief \u201cdoes not\nby any means necessarily imply that courts should award\nmoney damages.\u201d Schweiker, 487 U. S., at 421. Second,\nPassman indicated that a damages remedy is appropriate\nunless Congress \u201cexplicit[ly]\u201d declares that a claimant \u201cmay\nnot recover money damages.\u201d 442 U. S., at 246\u2013247 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted). Now,\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthough, we defer to \u201ccongressional inaction\u201d if \u201cthe design\nof a Government program suggests that Congress has pro-\nvided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms.\u201d\nSchweiker, 487 U. S., at 423; see also Ziglar, 582 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 14). Third, when assessing the \u201cspecial fac-\ntors,\u201d Passman asked whether a court is competent to cal-\nculate damages \u201cwithout difficult questions of valuation or\ncausation.\u201d 442 U. S., at 245. But today, we do not ask\nwhether a court can determine a damages amount. Rather,\nwe ask whether \u201cthere are sound reasons to think Congress\nmight doubt the efficacy or necessity of a damages remedy\u201d\nat all. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n   In short, as we explained in Ziglar, a plaintiff cannot jus-\ntify a Bivens extension based on \u201cparallel circumstances\u201d\nwith Bivens, Passman, or Carlson unless he also satisfies\nthe \u201canalytic framework\u201d prescribed by the last four dec-\nades of intervening case law. 582 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op.,\nat 15\u201316). Boule has failed to do so.\n                              IV\n   Since it was decided, Bivens has had no shortage of de-\ntractors. See, e.g., Bivens, 403 U. S., at 411 (Burger, C. J.,\ndissenting); id., at 427 (Black, J., dissenting); id., at 430\n(Blackmun, J., dissenting); Carlson, 446 U. S., at 31\n(Rehnquist, J., dissenting); Malesko, 534 U. S., at 75\n(Scalia, J., concurring); Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1); post, at 1\u20133 (opin-\nion of GORSUCH, J.). And, more recently, we have indicated\nthat if we were called to decide Bivens today, we would de-\ncline to discover any implied causes of action in the Consti-\ntution. See Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). But, to\ndecide the case before us, we need not reconsider Bivens it-\nself. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U.

ROBERT BOULE\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                         [June 8, 2022]\n\n   JUSTICE GORSUCH, concurring in the judgment.\n   Our Constitution\u2019s separation of powers prohibits federal\ncourts from assuming legislative authority. As the Court\ntoday acknowledges, Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics\nAgents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), crossed that line by\n\u201cimpl[ying]\u201d a new set of private rights and liabilities Con-\ngress never ordained. Ante, at 5\u20136; see also Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286 (2001); Nestl\u00e9 USA, Inc. v.\nDoe, 593 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2021) (GORSUCH, J., concur-\nring) (slip op., at 4\u20137).\n   Recognizing its misstep, this Court has struggled for dec-\nades to find its way back. Initially, the Court told lower\ncourts to follow a \u201ctwo ste[p]\u201d inquiry before applying\nBivens to any new situation. Ante, at 7. At the first step, a\ncourt had to ask whether the case before it presented a \u201cnew\ncontext\u201d meaningfully different from Bivens. Ante, at 7. At\nthe second, a court had to consider whether \u201c \u2018special fac-\ntors\u2019 \u201d counseled hesitation before recognizing a new cause\nof action. Ibid. But these tests soon produced their own set\nof questions: What distinguishes the first step from the sec-\nond? What makes a context \u201cnew\u201d or a factor \u201cspecial\u201d?\nAnd, most fundamentally, on what authority may courts\nrecognize new causes of action even under these standards?\n   Today, the Court helpfully answers some of these linger-\ning questions. It recognizes that our two-step inquiry really\nboils down to a \u201csingle question\u201d: Is there \u201cany reason to\n\f2                     EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n               GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthink Congress might be better equipped\u201d than a court to\n\u201c \u2018weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action\nto proceed\u2019 \u201d? Ante, at 7\u20138; see Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U. S.\n120, ___\u2013___ (2017) (slip op., at 13\u201314). But, respectfully,\nresolving that much only serves to highlight the larger re-\nmaining question: When might a court ever be \u201cbetter\nequipped\u201d than the people\u2019s elected representatives to\nweigh the \u201ccosts and benefits\u201d of creating a cause of action?\n    It seems to me that to ask the question is to answer it. To\ncreate a new cause of action is to assign new private rights\nand liabilities\u2014a power that is in every meaningful sense\nan act of legislation. See Sandoval, 532 U. S., at 286\u2013287;\nNestl\u00e9, 593 U. S., at ___ (GORSUCH, J., concurring) (slip op.,\nat 5); Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, 584 U. S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(GORSUCH, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-\nment) (slip op., at 3). If exercising that sort of authority\nmay once have been a \u201c \u2018proper function for common-law\ncourts\u2019 \u201d in England, it is no longer generally appropriate\n\u201c \u2018for federal tribunals\u2019 \u201d in a republic where the people elect\nrepresentatives to make the rules that govern them. Sand-\noval, 532 U. S., at 287. Weighing the costs and benefits of\nnew laws is the bread and butter of legislative committees.\nIt has no place in federal courts charged with deciding cases\nand controversies under existing law.\n    Instead of saying as much explicitly, however, the Court\nproceeds on to conduct a case-specific analysis. And there I\nconfess difficulties. The plaintiff is an American citizen\nwho argues that a federal law enforcement officer violated\nthe Fourth Amendment in searching the curtilage of his\nhome. Candidly, I struggle to see how this set of facts dif-\nfers meaningfully from those in Bivens itself. To be sure, as\nthe Court emphasizes, the episode here took place near an\ninternational border and the officer\u2019s search focused on vio-\nlations of the immigration laws. But why does that matter?\nThe Court suggests that Fourth Amendment violations\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             3\n\n               GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmatter less in this context because of \u201clikely\u201d national-secu-\nrity risks. Ante, at 11\u201312. So once more, we tote up for\nourselves the costs and benefits of a private right of action\nin this or that setting and reach a legislative judgment. To\natone for Bivens, it seems we continue repeating its most\nbasic mistake.\n   Of course, the Court\u2019s real messages run deeper than its\ncase-specific analysis. If the costs and benefits do not jus-\ntify a new Bivens action on facts so analogous to Bivens it-\nself, it\u2019s hard to see how they ever could. And if the only\nquestion is whether a court is \u201cbetter equipped\u201d than Con-\ngress to weigh the value of a new cause of action, surely the\nright answer will always be no. Doubtless, these are the\nlessons the Court seeks to convey. I would only take the\nnext step and acknowledge explicitly what the Court leaves\nbarely implicit. Sometimes, it seems, \u201cthis Court leaves a\ndoor ajar and holds out the possibility that someone, some-\nday might walk through it\u201d even as it devises a rule that\nensures \u201cno one . . . ever will.\u201d Edwards v. Vannoy, 593\nU. S. ___, ___ (2021) (GORSUCH, J., concurring) (slip op.,\nat 1).

The Court\u2019s innovations, taken together, enable it\nto close the door to Boule\u2019s claim and, presumably, to others\nthat fall squarely within Bivens\u2019 ambit.\n   Today\u2019s decision does not overrule Bivens. It neverthe-\nless contravenes precedent and will strip many more indi-\nviduals who suffer injuries at the hands of other federal of-\nficers, and whose circumstances are materially\nindistinguishable from those in Bivens, of an important\nremedy. I therefore dissent from the Court\u2019s disposition of\nBoule\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim. I concur in the Court\u2019s\njudgment that Boule\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim\n\f2                      EGBERT v.

The\nCourt is therefore bound to draw all reasonable factual in-\nferences in favor of Boule. See Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U. S.\n650, 656\u2013657 (2014) (per curiam). Because the Court fails\nto do so, the factual record is described below in some detail,\nin the light our precedent requires.\n                              A\n  Boule is a U. S. citizen who owns, operates, and lives in a\nsmall bed-and-breakfast called the Smuggler\u2019s Inn in\nBlaine, Washington. The property line of the land on which\nthe inn is located touches the U. S.-Canada border. Shortly\nafter purchasing the property in 2000, Boule became aware\nthat people used his property to cross the border illegally in\nboth directions. Boule began serving as a paid, confidential\ninformant for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in\n2003 and for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\nin 2008. At the time of the events at issue in this case,\nBoule was still serving as an informant for ICE. ICE would\ncoordinate with CBP and other agencies based on the infor-\nmation Boule provided. Over the years, Boule provided in-\nformation leading to numerous arrests.\n  On the morning of March 20, 2014, petitioner Erik Eg-\nbert, a CBP agent, twice stopped Boule while Boule was\nrunning errands in town. Agent Egbert knew that Boule\nwas a long-time informant for ICE and that he had previ-\nously worked as an informant for CBP. Agent Egbert asked\nBoule about guests at the inn, and Boule advised him of a\nguest he expected to arrive that day from New York who\nhad flown in from Turkey the day before. Boule explained\nthat two of his employees were en route to pick the guest up\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)           3\n\n                   S\n                   Opinion of S, OTOMAYOR\n                    OTOMAYOR     J., dissenting\n                                            , J.\n\nat the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Agent Egbert\ncontinued patrolling in his CBP vehicle for the rest of the\nmorning but stayed near the inn so he would see when the\ncar carrying the guest returned. When it arrived, he fol-\nlowed the car into the driveway of the inn, passing a \u201cno\ntrespassing\u201d sign. Agent Egbert parked his vehicle behind\nthe arriving car in the driveway immediately adjacent to\nthe inn.\n  Agent Egbert exited his patrol vehicle and approached\nthe car. Boule\u2019s employee also exited the car; the guest re-\nmained inside. From the front porch of his inn, Boule asked\nAgent Egbert to leave. When Agent Egbert refused, Boule\nstepped off the porch, positioned himself between Agent Eg-\nbert and the vehicle, and explained that the person in the\ncar was a guest who had come from New York to Seattle\nand who had been through security at the airport. Boule\nagain asked Agent Egbert to leave. Agent Egbert grabbed\nBoule by his chest, lifted him up, and shoved him against\nthe vehicle and then threw him to the ground. Boule landed\non his hip and shoulder.\n  Agent Egbert opened the car door and asked the guest\nabout his immigration status. Boule called 911 to request\na supervisor; Agent Egbert relayed the same request over\nhis radio. Several minutes later, a supervisor and another\nagent arrived at the inn. After concluding that the guest\nwas lawfully in the country (just as Boule had previously\ninformed Agent Egbert), the three officers departed. Boule\nlater sought medical treatment for his injuries.\n  Boule complained to Agent Egbert\u2019s superiors about the\nincident and filed an administrative claim with CBP, which\nallegedly prompted Agent Egbert to retaliate against Boule.\nAgent Egbert contacted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),\nthe Social Security Administration, the Washington State\nDepartment of Licensing, and the Whatcom County Asses-\nsor\u2019s Office, asking them to investigate Boule\u2019s business.\nThese agencies did so, but none found that Boule had done\n\f4                      EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                    S\n                    Opinion of S, OTOMAYOR\n                     OTOMAYOR     J., dissenting\n                                             , J.\n\nanything wrong. Boule paid over $5,000 to his accountant\nto assist him in responding to the IRS\u2019 tax audit. Boule also\nfiled claims pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act\n(FTCA), which were denied. CBP\u2019s investigation of Agent\nEgbert concluded that he failed to be forthcoming with in-\nvestigators and \u201cdemonstrated lack of integrity,\u201d serious of-\nfenses that warranted his removal. Rev. Redacted App.\n184.\n                              B\n  Boule sued Agent Egbert in Federal District Court, seek-\ning damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics\nAgents, 403 U. S. 388, for violation of Boule\u2019s First and\nFourth Amendment rights. The District Court granted\nsummary judgment to Agent Egbert on both claims. The\nCourt of Appeals reversed, concluding that both claims\nwere cognizable under Bivens. In the Court of Appeals\u2019\nview, Boule\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim constituted a mod-\nest extension of Bivens. Even so, the court explained, no\nspecial factors counseled hesitation such that this extension\nshould be foreclosed; rather, \u201cBoule\u2019s Fourth Amendment\nexcessive force claim is part and parcel of the \u2018common and\nrecurrent sphere of law enforcement\u2019 \u201d that remained \u201ca per-\nmissible area for Bivens claims.\u201d 998 F. 3d 370, 389 (CA9\n2021) (quoting Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11)). The\ncourt separately held that Boule\u2019s First Amendment claim\ncould proceed under Bivens.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 595 U.

The Fourth Amendment, the\nCourt explained, \u201cguarantees to citizens of the United\nStates the absolute right to be free from unreasonable\nsearches and seizures carried out by virtue of federal au-\nthority.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court ultimately held that a \u201cviolation of [the Fourth\nAmendment] by a federal agent acting under color of his\nauthority gives rise to a cause of action for damages.\u201d Id.,\nat 389. In doing so, the Court observed that existing state-\nlaw causes of action were no substitute for a federal cause\nof action because \u201c[t]he interests protected by state laws\nregulating trespass and the invasion of privacy\u201d and those\nprotected by the Fourth Amendment \u201cmay be inconsistent\nor even hostile.\u201d Id., at 394; see also id., at 410 (Harlan, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201cFor people in Bivens\u2019 shoes, it is\ndamages or nothing\u201d).1 The Court also noted that the case\nbefore it \u201cinvolve[d] no special factors counselling hesita-\ntion,\u201d such as a question concerning federal fiscal policy.\nId., at 396.\n   This Court has twice extended the cause of action first\narticulated in Bivens: first to a Fifth Amendment due pro-\ncess claim for sex discrimination, see Davis v. Passman, 442\nU. S. 228 (1979), and then to an Eighth Amendment delib-\nerate indifference claim for failure to provide proper medi-\ncal attention, see Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14 (1980). In\nDavis, Carlson, and subsequent cases, the Court built on\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For example, an individual \u201cmay bar the door against an unwelcome\n\nprivate intruder, or call the police if he persists in seeking entrance\u201d and\nmay seek damages under state law \u201cfor any consequent trespass.\u201d\nBivens, 403 U. S., at 394. By contrast, \u201c[t]he mere invocation of federal\npower by a federal law enforcement official will normally render futile\nany attempt to resist an unlawful entry or arrest by resort to the local\npolice; and a claim of authority to enter is likely to unlock the door as\nwell.\u201d Ibid.\n\f6                      EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                    S\n                    Opinion of S, OTOMAYOR\n                     OTOMAYOR     J., dissenting\n                                             , J.\n\nBivens\u2019 inquiry to develop a two-step test for determining\nwhether a Bivens cause of action may be \u201cdefeated.\u201d Carl-\nson, 446 U. S., at 18. First, the Court considered whether,\nunder the circumstances of a particular case, special factors\ncounseled hesitation in allowing a private right of action to\nproceed. See, e.g., Bivens, 403 U. S., at 396; Davis, 442\nU. S., at 246; Carlson, 446 U. S., at 18; Bush v. Lucas, 462\nU. S. 367, 377\u2013380 (1983). Second, the Court considered\nwhether \u201cCongress has provided an alternative remedy\nwhich it explicitly declared to be a substitute for recovery\ndirectly under the Constitution and viewed as equally effec-\ntive.\u201d Carlson, 446 U. S., at 18\u201319; see also, e.g., Davis, 442\nU. S., at 246\u2013247; Bush, 462 U. S., at 377\u2013378; Wilkie v.\nRobbins, 551 U. S. 537, 550 (2007) (describing this two-step\ntest). Where, for example, Congress crafted an \u201celaborate\nremedial system that has been constructed step by step,\nwith careful attention to conflicting policy considerations,\u201d\nBush, 462 U. S., at 388, this Court concluded that \u201cit would\nbe inappropriate . . . to supplement that regulatory scheme\nwith a new judicial remedy,\u201d id., at 368; accord, Schweiker\nv. Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412, 414 (1988). Applying this two-\nstep test, the Court has declined to extend Bivens beyond\nsituations like those addressed in Davis, Carlson, and\nBivens itself. See ante, at 1.\n   In Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U. S. 120, the Court not only de-\nclined to extend Bivens but also revised and narrowed its\ntwo-step analytic framework. The Ziglar Court set forth a\nnew inquiry requiring courts considering a Bivens claim\nfirst to ask whether a case \u201cis different in a meaningful way\nfrom previous Bivens cases decided by this Court\u201d and\ntherefore arises in a \u201cnew . . . context.\u201d 582 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 16); see also Hern\u00e1ndez v. Mesa, 589 U. S. ___,\n___ (2020) (slip op., at 7). The Ziglar Court offered a laun-\ndry list of differences that \u201cmight\u201d be meaningful, including\n\u201cthe rank of the officers involved; the constitutional right at\nissue; the generality or specificity of the official action; the\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). The Court\nrecognized, however, that some differences \u201cwill be so triv-\nial that they will not suffice to create a new Bivens context.\u201d\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 26).\n  If the differences are in fact \u201cmeaningful ones,\u201d ibid.,\n\u201cthen the context is new,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op., at 16), and a\ncourt \u201cproceed[s] to the second step\u201d of the analysis, Her-\nn\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). The second step\nrequires courts to consider whether special factors counsel\nhesitation in recognizing a Bivens remedy in a new context.\nZiglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12); Hern\u00e1ndez, 589\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).\n  Importantly, even as the Ziglar Court grafted a more de-\nmanding new-context inquiry onto the traditional Bivens\nframework, the Court emphasized that its opinion was \u201cnot\nintended to cast doubt on the continued force, or even the\nnecessity, of Bivens in the search-and-seizure context in\nwhich it arose.\u201d 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Quite the\nopposite: The Court recognized that Bivens \u201cvindicate[s] the\nConstitution by allowing some redress for injuries\u201d and\n\u201cprovides instruction and guidance to federal law enforce-\nment officers going forward.\u201d 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n11). Accordingly, the Court explained, there are \u201cpowerful\nreasons to retain [Bivens]\u201d in the \u201ccommon and recurrent\nsphere of law enforcement.\u201d Ibid. The Court further recog-\nnized that \u201cindividual instances of discrimination or law en-\nforcement overreach\u201d are, by their nature, \u201cdifficult to ad-\ndress except by way of damages actions after the fact.\u201d Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 21).\n\f8                         EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                       S\n                       Opinion of S, OTOMAYOR\n                        OTOMAYOR     J., dissenting\n                                                , J.\n\n                             B\n   Ziglar and Hern\u00e1ndez control here. Applying the two-\nstep framework set forth in those cases, the Court of Ap-\npeals\u2019 determination that Boule\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim\nis cognizable under Bivens should be affirmed for two inde-\npendent reasons. First, Boule\u2019s claim does not present a\nnew context. Second, even if it did, no special factors would\ncounsel hesitation.\n                              1\n   Boule\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim does not arise in a new\ncontext. Bivens itself involved a U. S. citizen bringing a\nFourth Amendment claim against individual, rank-and-file\nfederal law enforcement officers who allegedly violated his\nconstitutional rights within the United States by entering\nhis property without a warrant and using excessive force.\nThose are precisely the facts of Boule\u2019s complaint.\n   The only arguably salient difference in \u201ccontext\u201d between\nthis case and Bivens is that the defendants in Bivens were\nemployed at the time by the (now-defunct) Federal Bureau\nof Narcotics, while Agent Egbert was employed by CBP. As\ndiscussed, however, this Court\u2019s precedent instructs that\nsome differences are too \u201ctrivial . . . to create a new Bivens\ncontext.\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26).2 That it\nwas a CBP agent rather than a Federal Bureau of Narcotics\nagent who unlawfully entered Boule\u2019s property and used\nconstitutionally excessive force against him plainly is not\nthe sort of \u201cmeaningful\u201d distinction that our new-context in-\nquiry is designed to weed out. Ibid.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Egbert argues in passing that the fact that he was operating under a\n\n\u201c \u2018statutory . . . mandate\u2019 not invoked in prior cases,\u201d standing alone,\n\u201cdooms [Boule\u2019s] no-new-context argument.\u201d Reply Brief 19 (quoting\nZiglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16)). Not so. Egbert fails to show\nthat any difference in statutory mandates as between CBP agents and\nother law enforcement officers is \u201cmeaningful,\u201d which our precedents re-\nquire him to do. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16).\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 11);\nsee also Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). The\nCourt, however, has never relied on this principle to draw\nartificial distinctions between line-level officers of the 83\ndifferent federal law enforcement agencies with authority\nto make arrests and provide police protection. See Dept. of\nJustice, C. Brooks, Federal Law Enforcement Officers,\n2016\u2014Statistical Tables (NCJ 251922, Oct. 2019),\nhttps://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/fleo16st.pdf. Indeed, if\nthe \u201cnew context\u201d inquiry were defined at such a fine level\nof granularity, every case would raise a new context, be-\ncause the Federal Bureau of Narcotics no longer exists. See\nNational Archives, Records of the Drug Enforcement Admin-\nistration [DEA] (Aug. 15, 2016), https://www.archives.gov/\nresearch/guide-fed-records/groups/170.html.\n   Moreover, the \u201cnew category of defendants\u201d language\ntraces back to a different concern raised in the Court\u2019s de-\ncision in Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S.\n61, 68 (2001). That case involved an Eighth Amendment\nclaim brought by a federal prisoner against a private corpo-\nration under contract with the federal Bureau of Prisons.\nThe Court observed that \u201cthe threat of suit against an indi-\nvidual\u2019s employer,\u201d rather than \u201cthe individual directly re-\nsponsible for the alleged injury,\u201d \u201cwas not the kind of deter-\nrence contemplated by Bivens.\u201d Id., at 70\u201371. Applying\nBivens to a corporate defendant would amount to a \u201cmarked\nextension of Bivens . . . to contexts that would not advance\nBivens\u2019 core purpose of deterring individual officers from\nengaging in unconstitutional wrongdoing.\u201d Malesko, 534\nU. S., at 74; see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 485\n(1994) (declining to allow a Bivens claim to proceed against\na federal agency for similar reasons). Here, by contrast,\nBoule\u2019s suit against Agent Egbert directly advances that\ncore purpose.\n\f10                      EGBERT v.

His case therefore does\nnot present a new context for the purposes of assessing\nwhether a Bivens remedy is available.\n                                 2\n   Even assuming that this case presents a new context, no\nspecial factors warrant foreclosing a Bivens action.\n   The Court \u201chas not defined the phrase \u2018special factors\ncounselling hesitation,\u2019 \u201d but it has recognized that the \u201cin-\nquiry must concentrate on whether the Judiciary is well\nsuited, absent congressional action or instruction, to con-\nsider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a dam-\nages action to proceed.\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12); see also Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n7\u20138).

Boule\u2019s case, however,\nis a far cry from others in which the Court declined to ex-\ntend Bivens for reasons of national security or foreign rela-\ntions. In Hern\u00e1ndez, for example, a CBP agent shot and\nkilled a Mexican child across the U. S.-Mexico border. 589\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            11\n\n                    S\n                    Opinion of S, OTOMAYOR\n                     OTOMAYOR     J., dissenting\n                                             , J.\n\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The Mexican Government un-\nsuccessfully sought extradition of the agent to Mexico, and\nafter an investigation, the U. S. Department of Justice de-\nclined to bring charges against the agent. Ibid. The par-\nents of the deceased child attempted to bring a Bivens ac-\ntion against the CBP agent, but this Court held that several\n\u201cwarning flags\u201d counseled caution, including a \u201cpotential ef-\nfect on foreign relations.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9). The Court observed that \u201c[a] cross-border shoot-\ning is by definition an international incident,\u201d and that both\nthe United States and Mexico had \u201clegitimate and im-\nportant interests that may be affected by the way in which\nthis matter is handled.\u201d Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 9, 11).\nThe Court concluded that because \u201cregulating the conduct\nof agents at the border unquestionably has national secu-\nrity implications, the risk of undermining border security\nprovides reason to hesitate before extending Bivens into\nthis field.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   The conduct here took place near an international border\nand involved a CBP agent. That, however, is where the\nsimilarities with Hern\u00e1ndez begin and end. The conduct\noccurred exclusively on U. S. soil, and the injury was to a\nU. S. citizen. This case therefore does not present an \u201cin-\nternational incident\u201d that might affect diplomatic relations,\nunlike the cross-border killing of a foreign-national child.\nAs for national-security concerns, the Court in Hern\u00e1ndez\nemphasized that \u201csome [CBP agents] are stationed right at\nthe border and have the responsibility of attempting to pre-\nvent illegal entry\u201d; it was \u201c[f]or th[i]s reaso[n],\u201d among oth-\ners, that their conduct had \u201ca clear and strong connection\nto national security.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13). Here, by\ncontrast, Agent Egbert was not \u201cattempting to prevent ille-\ngal entry\u201d or otherwise engaged in activities with a \u201cstrong\nconnection to national security.\u201d Ibid. Agent Egbert was\naware (because Boule had told him earlier in the day and\nagain at the scene) that the foreign national arriving at the\n\f12                     EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                    S\n                    Opinion of S, OTOMAYOR\n                     OTOMAYOR     J., dissenting\n                                             , J.\n\ninn had already entered the United States by airplane and\nhad been processed by U. S. customs at the airport in New\nYork the previous day.\n   Nor does this case present special factors similar to those\nthat deterred the Court from recognizing a Bivens action in\nZiglar. In that case, foreign nationals who had been unlaw-\nfully present in the United States brought a Bivens action\nagainst three \u201chigh executive officers in the Department of\nJustice\u201d and two wardens of the facility where they had\nbeen held. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The\nCourt reasoned that allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 claims to pro-\nceed against the executive officers \u201cwould call into question\nthe formulation and implementation of a general policy,\u201d\nand that the discovery and litigation process would \u201cborder\nupon or directly implicate the discussion and deliberations\nthat led to the formation of the policy in question,\u201d thereby\nimplicating sensitive national-security functions entrusted\nto Congress and the President. Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n17\u201318). If Bivens liability were imposed, the Court ex-\nplained, \u201chigh officers who face personal liability for dam-\nages might refrain from taking urgent and lawful action in\na time of crisis,\u201d and \u201cthe costs and difficulties of later liti-\ngation might intrude upon and interfere with the proper ex-\nercise of their office.\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n22).\n   Here, Boule plainly does not seek to challenge or alter\n\u201chigh-level executive policy.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16). Al-\nlowing his claim to proceed would not require courts to in-\ntrude into \u201cthe discussion and deliberations that led to the\nformation\u201d of any policy or national-security decision or in-\nterest. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 18). Agent Egbert, a line of-\nficer, was engaged in a run-of-the-mill inquiry into the sta-\ntus of a foreign national on U.

No special factors counsel\nagainst allowing Boule\u2019s Bivens action to proceed.\n                               C\n   Boule also argues that his First Amendment retaliatory-\ninvestigation claim is cognizable under Bivens. I concur in\nthe Court\u2019s judgment that it is not, but I arrive at that con-\nclusion by following precedent rather than by applying the\nCourt\u2019s new, single-step inquiry. Ante, at 7; see infra, at\n15\u201317.\n   This Court has repeatedly assumed without deciding that\nBivens extends to First Amendment claims, see Wood v.\nMoss, 572 U. S. 744, 757 (2014), but has never squarely held\nas much, see Reichle v. Howards, 566 U. S. 658, 663, n. 4\n(2012). Accordingly, Boule\u2019s First Amendment retaliation\npresents a new context for the purpose of the Bivens analy-\nsis. See Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24) (noting that\na case can present a new context if it implicates a different\nconstitutional right than those already recognized as cog-\nnizable under Bivens).\n   Moving to the second step of the Bivens inquiry, unlike\nBoule\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim, there is \u201creason to\npause\u201d before extending Bivens to Boule\u2019s First Amendment\nclaim. Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). In par-\nticular, his First Amendment claim raises line-drawing con-\ncerns similar to those this Court identified in Wilkie, 551\nU. S. 537. In Wilkie, a landowner sought to bring a Bivens\naction against federal officials whom the landowner ac-\ncused of harassment and intimidation meant to extract an\neasement across his property. 551 U. S., at 541. The Court\nobserved that \u201cdefining a workable cause of action\u201d for such\na claim was \u201cdifficul[t].\u201d Id., at 555; see also id., at 557.\nRecognizing a Bivens action to redress retaliation under\nsuch circumstances would, in the Court\u2019s view, \u201cinvite\n\f14                     EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                    S\n                    Opinion of S, OTOMAYOR\n                     OTOMAYOR     J., dissenting\n                                             , J.\n\nclaims in every sphere of legitimate governmental action af-\nfecting property interests\u201d and \u201cacross this enormous swath\nof potential litigation would hover the difficulty of devising\na . . . standard that could guide an employee\u2019s conduct and\na judicial factfinder\u2019s conclusion.\u201d 551 U. S., at 561. Be-\ncause of the \u201celusiveness of a limiting principle\u201d for claims\nlike the landowner\u2019s, id., at 561, n. 11, the Court decided\nthat courts were ill equipped to tailor an appropriate rem-\nedy, id., at 562.\n   Boule\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim raises similar\nconcerns. Unlike the constitutional rights this Court has\nrecognized as cognizable under Bivens, First Amendment\nretaliation claims could potentially be brought against\nmany different federal officers, stretching substantially be-\nyond the \u201ccommon and recurrent sphere of law enforce-\nment\u201d to reach virtually all federal employees. Ziglar, 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Under such circumstances,\nthis Court\u2019s precedent holds that \u201c \u2018evaluat[ing] the impact\nof a new species of litigation\u2019 \u201d on the efficiency of civil ser-\nvice is a task for Congress, not the courts. Wilkie, 551 U. S.,\nat 562; see also Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). I\ntherefore concur in the judgment as to the Court\u2019s reversal\nof the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that Boule\u2019s First\nAmendment Bivens action may proceed, not for the reasons\nthe Court identifies, ante, at 13\u201316, but because precedent\nrequires it.\n                            III\n   If the legal standard the Court articulates to reject\nBoule\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim sounds unfamiliar, that\nis because it is. Just five years after circumscribing the\nstandard for allowing Bivens claims to proceed, a restless\nand newly constituted Court sees fit to refashion the stand-\nard anew to foreclose remedies in yet more cases. The\nmeasures the Court takes to ensure Boule\u2019s claim is dis-\nmissed are inconsistent with governing precedent.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

See Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 7) (\u201cWhen asked to extend Bivens, we en-\ngage in a two-step inquiry\u201d). Today, however, the Court\npays lip service to the test set out in our precedents, but\neffectively replaces it with a new single-step inquiry de-\nsigned to constrict Bivens. Ante, at 7 (acknowledging this\nCourt\u2019s previous \u201ctwo ste[p]\u201d standard but insisting that\n\u201cthose steps often resolve to a single question: whether\nthere is any reason to think that Congress might be better\nequipped to create a damages remedy\u201d); ante, at 8 (positing\nthat \u201c[t]he newness of [some] \u2018new context[s]\u2019 should alone\nrequire dismissal\u201d (some internal quotation marks omit-\nted)). The Court goes so far as to announce that \u201c[t]he\nBivens inquiry does not invite federal courts to inde-\npendently assess the costs and benefits of implying a cause\nof action,\u201d ante, at 11; instead, courts must \u201conly\u201d decide\n\u201cwhether there is any rational reason (even one) to think\nthat Congress is better suited to \u2018weigh the costs and bene-\nfits of allowing a damages action to proceed,\u2019 \u201d ibid. (quoting\nZiglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12)).\n   That approach contrasts starkly with the standard the\nCourt announced in Ziglar and applied in Hern\u00e1ndez. This\nCourt regularly has considered whether courts are \u201cwell\nsuited . . . to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of\nallowing a damages action to proceed,\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 12), and have never held that such weighing\nis categorically impermissible, contrary to the Court\u2019s anal-\nysis today. See also Wilkie, 551 U. S., at 554 (noting that\nthe Bivens inquiry asks courts to \u201cweig[h] reasons for and\nagainst the creation of a new cause of action\u201d).\n   The Court justifies its innovations by selectively quoting\nour precedents and presenting its newly announced stand-\n\f16                     EGBERT v.

The Court\u2019s repeated cita-\ntion to United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669 (1987), is just\none example. The Court cites Stanley for, among other\nthings, the proposition that the special-factors analysis\nmust be conducted at a very broad level of generality. Ante,\nat 11. Stanley, however, cautioned against a case-specific\nspecial-factors analysis in the narrow context of \u201cjudicial in-\ntrusion upon military discipline.\u201d 483 U. S., at 681. As it\nhad in previous cases seeking to raise Bivens actions in the\nmilitary context, the Stanley Court emphasized the need to\nbe \u201cprotective of military concerns,\u201d 483 U. S., at 681, and\nto avoid \u201ccall[ing] into question military discipline and de-\ncisionmaking,\u201d id., at 682. The Court therefore determined\nthat in the military sphere, the special-factors analysis\nshould be applied somewhat more broadly than the re-\nspondent urged. Id., at 681. Stanley, in other words, re-\nflected the Court\u2019s longstanding approach to Bivens cases:\nconsidering the facts and the substantive context of each\ncase and determining whether special factors counseled\nhesitation. Stanley did not purport to articulate a special-\nfactors framework that should apply to all Bivens cases go-\ning forward.\n   The Court further declares that \u201ca plaintiff cannot justify\na Bivens extension based on \u2018parallel circumstances\u2019 \u201d with\nprevious cases that have recognized a Bivens remedy. Ante,\nat 17. To the extent these statements suggest an exacting\nnew-context inquiry, they are in serious tension with the\nCourt\u2019s longstanding rule that trivial differences alone do\nnot create a new Bivens context. See Ziglar, 582 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 26); see also ante, at 2 (GORSUCH, J., concur-\nring in judgment) (\u201cCandidly, I struggle to see how this set\nof facts differs meaningfully from those in Bivens itself \u201d).\nIndeed, until today, the Court has never so much as hinted\nthat courts should refuse to permit a Bivens action in a case\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

Even assuming the claim presents a new con-\ntext, the Court\u2019s insistence that national-security concerns\nbar the claim directly contravenes Ziglar. Moreover, the\nCourt\u2019s holding that a nonbinding administrative investi-\ngation process, internal to the agency and offering no mean-\ningful protection of the constitutional interests at stake,\nconstitutes an alternative remedy that forecloses Bivens re-\nlief blinks reality.\n                               1\n   The Court acknowledges the force of the Court of Appeals\u2019\nconclusion that Bivens and this case present \u201c \u2018almost par-\nallel circumstances,\u2019 \u201d but it nonetheless concludes that a\nmost unlikely special factor counsels hesitation: the\n\u201cnational-security context.\u201d Ante, at 10. By the Court\u2019s tell-\ning, Hern\u00e1ndez declined to recognize a Bivens action \u201cbe-\ncause \u2018regulating the conduct of agents at the border un-\nquestionably has national security implications,\u2019 and the\n\u2018risk of undermining border security provides reason to hes-\nitate before extending Bivens into this field.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The Court supports its decision not to recognize an action under\n\nBivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), by\nobserving that we have declined to recognize a Bivens-style cause of ac-\ntion for other constitutional violations. Ante, at 1. What the Court fails\nto acknowledge, however, is that each of those cases presented a mean-\ningfully new context and/or raised special factors counseling hesitation\nthat are not present in this case. See supra, at 6, 9\u201310, 13\u201314, 15\u201316;\ninfra, at 21\u201322. The one exception is Hui v. Castaneda, 559 U. S. 799,\n808 (2010), in which the Court did not have to conduct this analysis be-\ncause it held the FTCA\u2019s comprehensive remedial scheme, which pro-\nvided both a cause of action and an exclusive damages remedy for the\nclaim at issue, clearly precluded a Bivens claim.\n\f18                     EGBERT v.

That\nreasoning, the Court concludes, \u201capplies here with full\nforce\u201d because \u201cnational security is at issue.\u201d Ante, at 9\u201310.\n   This is sheer hyperbole. Most obviously, the Court\u2019s con-\nclusion that this case, which involves a physical assault by\na federal officer against a U. S. citizen on U. S. soil, raises\n\u201cnational security\u201d concerns does exactly what this Court\ncounseled against just four years ago. Back then, the Court\nadvised that \u201cnational-security concerns must not become a\ntalisman to use to ward off inconvenient claims\u2014a \u2018label\u2019\nused to \u2018cover a multitude of sins.\u2019 \u201d Ziglar, 582 U.

The Court\nmay wish it were otherwise, but on the facts of this case, its\neffort to raise the specter of national security is mere sleight\nof hand.\n   Nor is there any indication that Congress acted to deny a\nBivens remedy for a case like this, which otherwise might\ncounsel hesitation. See Bush, 462 U. S., at 368 (declining\nto \u201csupplement\u201d Congress\u2019 existing scheme \u201cwith a new ju-\ndicial remedy\u201d). Congress has not provided that federal law\nenforcement officers may enter private property near a bor-\nder at any time or for any purpose. Quite the contrary: Con-\ngress has determined that immigration officers may enter\n\u201cprivate lands\u201d within 25 miles of an international border\nwithout a warrant only \u201cfor the purpose of patrolling the\nborder to prevent the illegal entry of aliens into the United\nStates.\u201d 66 Stat. 233, 8 U.

In keeping with the\nunprecedented level of generality the Court imports into\nthe special-factors analysis, the Court holds that courts are\nnot \u201ccompetent to authorize a damages action . . . against\nBorder Patrol agents generally.\u201d Ante, at 11. This extraor-\ndinary and gratuitous conclusion contradicts decades of\nprecedent requiring a context-specific determination of\nwhether a particular claim presents special factors counsel-\ning hesitation. See supra, at 6\u20138.4\n   The consequences of the Court\u2019s drive-by, categorical as-\nsertion will be severe. Absent intervention by Congress,\nCBP agents are now absolutely immunized from liability in\nany Bivens action for damages, no matter how egregious the\nmisconduct or resultant injury. That will preclude redress\nunder Bivens for injuries resulting from constitutional vio-\nlations by CBP\u2019s nearly 20,000 Border Patrol agents, in-\ncluding those engaged in ordinary law enforcement activi-\nties, like traffic stops, far removed from the border.

The Court\u2019s choice to foreclose liability\nfor constitutional violations that occur in the course of such\nactivities, based on even the most tenuous and hypothetical\nconnection to the border (and thereby, to the \u201cnational-\nsecurity context\u201d), betrays the context-specific nature of\nBivens and shrinks Bivens in the core Fourth Amendment\nlaw enforcement sphere where it is needed most.

Ante, at 12. The administrative\nremedy the Court perceives, however, is no remedy whatso-\never.\n  The sole \u201cremedy\u201d the Court cites is an administrative\ngrievance procedure that does not provide Boule with any\nrelief. The statute on which the Court relies provides: The\n\u201cSecretary of Homeland Security . . . shall have control, di-\nrection, and supervision of all employees and of all the files\nand records of [CBP].\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71103(a)(2); see ante, at\n12. Administrative regulations direct CBP to investigate\nalleged violations of its own standards by its own employ-\nees. See 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7287.10(a)\u2013(b).6 The Court sees fit to defer\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 To the extent the Court\u2019s decision may be motivated by fears that al-\n\nlowing this Bivens action to proceed will open the floodgates to countless\nclaims in the future, cf. ante, at 15, that concern is overblown. The doc-\ntrine of qualified immunity will continue to protect government officials\nfrom liability for damages unless a plaintiff \u201c \u2018pleads facts showing (1)\nthat the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that\nthe right was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the challenged con-\nduct.\u2019 \u201d Wood v.

In the Court\u2019s view, \u201c[s]o long as Con-\ngress or the Executive has created a remedial process that\nit finds sufficient to secure an adequate level of deterrence,\nthe courts cannot second-guess that calibration by superim-\nposing a Bivens remedy.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   This analysis drains the concept of \u201cremedy\u201d of all mean-\ning. To be sure, the Court has previously deemed Bivens\nclaims foreclosed by \u201csubstantive\u201d remedies to claimants\nthat are in significant part administrative. Bush, 462 U. S.,\nat 385; see also, e.g., Schweiker, 487 U. S., at 424\u2013425. The\nCourt also has recognized that existing remedies need not\n\u201cprovide complete relief for the plaintiff,\u201d Bush, 462 U. S.,\nat 388, including loss due to emotional distress or mental\nanguish, or attorney\u2019s fees, Schweiker, 487 U. S., at 424\u2013\n425. Until today, however, this Court has never held that\na threadbare disciplinary review process, expressly confer-\nring no substantive rights, \u201csecure[s] adequate deterrence\nand afford[s] . . . an alternative remedy.\u201d Ante, at 14. Nor\nhas it held that remedies providing no relief to the individ-\nual whose constitutional rights have been violated are \u201cad-\nequate\u201d for the purpose of foreclosing a Bivens action. To\nthe contrary, each of the alternative remedies the Court has\nrecognized has afforded participatory rights, an oppor-\ntunity for judicial review, and the potential to secure at\nleast some meaningful relief. See, e.g., Minneci v. Pollard,\n565 U. S. 118, 127 (2012) (state tort law); Ziglar, 582 U. S.,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nor in equity.\u201d Dept. of Homeland Security, Dept.

By the Court\u2019s logic, however,\nthe existence of any disciplinary framework, even if crafted\nby the Executive Branch rather than Congress, and even if\nwholly nonparticipatory and lacking any judicial review, is\nsufficient to bar a court from recognizing a Bivens remedy.\nThat reasoning, as disturbing as it is wrong, marks yet an-\nother erosion of Bivens\u2019 deterrent function in the law en-\nforcement sphere.8\n                                C\n   The Court thinly veils its disapproval of Bivens, ending\nits opinion by citing a string of dissenting opinions and\nsingle-Member concurrences by various Members of this\nCourt expressing criticisms of Bivens.

Although today\u2019s opinion will make it harder for\nplaintiffs to bring a successful Bivens claim, even in the\nFourth Amendment context, the lower courts should not\nread it to render Bivens a dead letter.\n   That said, the Court plainly modifies the Bivens standard\nin a manner that forecloses Boule\u2019s claims and others like\nthem that should be permitted under this Court\u2019s Bivens\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Even beyond its doctrinal innovations on the merits, the Court also\n\nfashions a brand new, Bivens-specific procedural rule under which it ex-\ncuses Egbert\u2019s forfeiture of his argument that CBP\u2019s administrative pro-\ncess suffices as an alternative remedy.

By nevertheless repeatedly amending\nthe legal standard that applies to Bivens claims and whit-\ntling down the number of claims that remain viable, the\nCourt itself is making a policy choice for Congress.

Argued March 2, 2022\u2014Decided June 8, 2022\nRespondent Robert Boule owns a bed-and-breakfast\u2014the Smuggler\u2019s\n  Inn\u2014in Blaine, Washington. The inn abuts the international border\n  between Canada and the United States. Boule at times helped federal\n  agents identify and apprehend persons engaged in unlawful cross-bor-\n  der activity on or near his property. But Boule also would provide\n  transportation and lodging to illegal border crossers. Often, Boule\n  would agree to help illegal border crossers enter or exit the United\n  States, only to later call federal agents to report the unlawful activity.\n    In 2014, Boule informed petitioner Erik Egbert, a U. S. Border Pa-\n  trol agent, that a Turkish national, arriving in Seattle by way of New\n  York, had scheduled transportation to Smuggler\u2019s Inn. When Agent\n  Egbert observed one of Boule\u2019s vehicles returning to the inn, he sus-\n  pected that the Turkish national was a passenger and followed the ve-\n  hicle to the inn. On Boule\u2019s account, Boule asked Egbert to leave, but\n  Egbert refused, became violent, and threw Boule first against the ve-\n  hicle and then to the ground. Egbert then checked the immigration\n  paperwork for Boule\u2019s guest and left after finding everything in order.\n  The Turkish guest unlawfully entered Canada later that evening.\n    Boule filed a grievance with Agent Egbert\u2019s supervisors and an ad-\n  ministrative claim with Border Patrol pursuant to the Federal Tort\n  Claims Act (FTCA). Egbert allegedly retaliated against Boule by re-\n  porting Boule\u2019s \u201cSMUGLER\u201d license plate to the Washington Depart-\n  ment of Licensing for referencing illegal activity, and by contacting the\n  Internal Revenue Service and prompting an audit of Boule\u2019s tax re-\n  turns. Boule\u2019s FTCA claim was ultimately denied, and Border Patrol\n  took no action against Egbert for his use of force or alleged acts of re-\n  taliation.

Abbasi, 582 U.

This two-step\n inquiry often resolves to a single question: whether there is any reason\n to think that Congress might be better equipped to create a damages\n remedy. Further, under the Court\u2019s precedents, a court may not fash-\n ion a Bivens remedy if Congress already has provided, or has author-\n ized the Executive to provide, \u201can alternative remedial structure.\u201d\n Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___. Pp. 5\u20138.\n    (b) The Court of Appeals conceded that Boule\u2019s Fourth Amendment\n claim presented a new Bivens context, but its conclusion that there\n was no reason to hesitate before recognizing a cause of action against\n Agent Egbert was incorrect for two independent reasons. Pp. 9\u201313.\n       (1) First, the \u201crisk of undermining border security provides reason\n to hesitate before extending Bivens into this field.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, 589\n U. S., at ___. In Hern\u00e1ndez, the Court declined to create a damages\n remedy for an excessive-force claim against a Border Patrol agent be-\n cause \u201cregulating the conduct of agents at the border unquestionably\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U.

That reasoning applies\nwith full force here. The Court of Appeals disagreed because it viewed\nBoule\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim as akin to a \u201cconventional\u201d exces-\nsive-force claim, as in Bivens, and less like the cross-border shooting\nin Hern\u00e1ndez. But that does not bear on the relevant point: Permitting\nsuit against a Border Patrol agent presents national security concerns\nthat foreclose Bivens relief. Further, the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis\nbetrays the pitfalls of applying the special-factors analysis at too gran-\nular a level. A court should not inquire whether Bivens relief is appro-\npriate in light of the balance of circumstances in the \u201cparticular case.\u201d\nUnited States v.

Rather, it should ask\n\u201c[m]ore broadly\u201d whether there is any reason to think that \u201cjudicial\nintrusion\u201d into a given field might be \u201charmful\u201d or \u201cinappropriate,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111954\"><a href=\"/opinion/111954/united-states-v-stanley/\">id.,\nat 681</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Pp. 9\u201312.\n      (2) Second, Congress has provided alternative remedies for ag-\ngrieved parties in Boule\u2019s position that independently foreclose a\nBivens action here. By regulation, Border Patrol must investigate\n\u201c[a]lleged violations\u201d and accept grievances from \u201c[a]ny persons.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8\nCFR \u00a7\u00a7287.10</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)\u2013(b). Boule claims that this regulatory grievance pro-\ncedure was inadequate, but this Court has never held that a Bivens\nalternative must afford rights such as judicial review of an adverse\ndetermination. Bivens \u201cis concerned solely with deterring the uncon-\nstitutional acts of individual officers.\u201d Correctional Services Corp. v.\nMalesko, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118466\"><a href=\"/opinion/118466/correctional-services-corp-v-malesko/\">534 U. S. 61</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71. And, regardless, the question whether a\ngiven remedy is adequate is a legislative determination. As in Her-\nn\u00e1ndez, this Court has no warrant to doubt that the consideration of\nBoule\u2019s grievance secured adequate deterrence and afforded Boule an\nalternative remedy. See 589 U. S., at ___. Pp. 12\u201313.\n   (c) There is no Bivens cause of action for Boule\u2019s First Amendment\nretaliation claim. That claim presents a new Bivens context, and there\nare many reasons to think that Congress is better suited to authorize\na damages remedy. Extending Bivens to alleged First Amendment vi-\nolations would pose an acute \u201crisk that fear of personal monetary lia-\nbility and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit officials in the dis-\ncharge of their duties.\u201d Anderson v. Creighton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\">483 U. S. 635</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 638. In\nlight of these costs, \u201cCongress is in a better position to decide whether\nor not the public interest would be served\u201d by imposing a damages ac-\ntion.

The Court of Appeals\u2019 reasons for ex-\ntending Bivens in this context\u2014that retaliation claims are \u201cwell-estab-\nlished\u201d and that Boule alleges that Agent Egbert \u201cwas not carrying out\nofficial duties\u201d when the retaliation occurred\u2014lack merit.

Even assum-\n    ing factual parallels, Passman carries little weight because it predates\n    the Court\u2019s current approach to implied causes of action. A plaintiff\n    cannot justify a Bivens extension based on \u201cparallel circumstances\u201d\n    with Bivens, Passman, or Carlson\u2014the three cases in which the Court\n    has implied a damages action\u2014unless the plaintiff also satisfies the\n    prevailing \u201canalytic framework\u201d prescribed by the last four decades of\n    intervening case law.

BOULE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n  Blaine, Washington, is the last town in the United States\nalong U. S. Interstate Highway 5 before reaching the Cana-\ndian border. Respondent Robert Boule is a longtime Blaine\nresident. The rear of his property abuts the Canadian bor-\nder at \u201c0 Avenue,\u201d a Canadian street. Boule\u2019s property line\nactually extends five feet into Canada. Several years ago,\nBoule placed a line of small stones on his property to mark\nthe international boundary. As shown below, any person\ncould easily enter the United States or Canada through or\nnear Boule\u2019s property. See App. 100.\n\n\n\n\n  Boule markets his home as a bed-and-breakfast aptly\nnamed \u201cSmuggler\u2019s Inn.\u201d The area surrounding the Inn \u201cis\na hotspot for cross-border smuggling of people, drugs, illicit\nmoney, and items of significance to criminal organizations.\u201d\nId., at 91. \u201cOn numerous occasions,\u201d U. S. Border Patrol\nagents \u201chave observed persons come south across the bor-\nder and walk into Smuggler\u2019s Inn through the back door.\u201d\nId., at 101. Federal agents also have seized from the Inn\nshipments of cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, and\nother narcotics. For a time, Boule served as a confidential\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

Boule claims that the Government\nhas paid him upwards of $60,000 for his services.\n   Ever the entrepreneur, Boule saw his relationship with\nBorder Patrol as a business opportunity. Boule would host\npersons who unlawfully entered the United States as\n\u201cguests\u201d at the Inn and offer to drive them to Seattle or else-\nwhere. He also would pick up Canada-bound guests\nthroughout the State and drive them north to his property\nalong the border. Either way, Boule would charge $100\u2013\n$150 per hour for his shuttle service and require guests to\npay for a night of lodging even if they never intended to stay\nat the Inn. Meanwhile, Boule would inform federal law en-\nforcement if he was scheduled to lodge or transport persons\nof interest. In short order, Border Patrol agents would ar-\nrive to arrest the guests, often within a few blocks of the\nInn. Boule would decline to offer his erstwhile customers a\nrefund. In his view, this practice was \u201cnothing any different\nthan [the] normal policies of any hotel/motel.\u201d Id., at 120.1\n   In light of Boule\u2019s business model, local Border Patrol\nagents, including petitioner Erik Egbert, were well ac-\nquainted with Smuggler\u2019s Inn and the criminal activity that\nattended it. On March 20, 2014, Boule informed Agent Eg-\nbert that a Turkish national, arriving in Seattle by way of\nNew York, had scheduled transportation to Smuggler\u2019s Inn\nlater that day. Agent Egbert grew suspicious, as he could\nthink of \u201cno legitimate reason a person would travel from\nTurkey to stay at a rundown bed-and-breakfast on the bor-\nder in Blaine.\u201d Id., at 104. The photograph below displays\nthe amenities for which Boule\u2019s Turkish guest would have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Notwithstanding his defense of the Inn\u2019s policies, Boule was recently\n\nconvicted in Canadian court for engaging in human trafficking. In De-\ncember 2021, he pleaded guilty to trafficking 11 Afghanis and Syrians\ninto Canada. He billed each foreign national between $200 and $700 for\nthe trip. See Regina v. Boule, 2021 BCSC 2561, \u00b6\u00b67\u201311.\n\f4                    EGBERT v. BOULE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntraveled more than 7,500 miles. See id., at 102.\n\n\n\n\n   Later that afternoon, Agent Egbert observed one of\nBoule\u2019s vehicles\u2014a black SUV with the license plate\n\u201cSMUGLER\u201d\u2014returning to the Inn. Agent Egbert sus-\npected that Boule\u2019s Turkish guest was a passenger and fol-\nlowed the SUV into the driveway so he could check the\nguest\u2019s immigration status. On Boule\u2019s account, the situa-\ntion escalated from there. Boule instructed Agent Egbert\nto leave his property, but Agent Egbert declined. Instead,\nBoule claims, Agent Egbert lifted him off the ground and\nthrew him against the SUV. After Boule collected himself,\nAgent Egbert allegedly threw him to the ground. Agent Eg-\nbert then checked the guest\u2019s immigration paperwork, con-\ncluded that everything was in order, and left. Later that\nevening, Boule\u2019s Turkish guest unlawfully entered Canada\nfrom Smuggler\u2019s Inn.\n   Boule lodged a grievance with Agent Egbert\u2019s supervi-\nsors, alleging that Agent Egbert had used excessive force\nand caused him physical injury. Boule also filed an admin-\nistrative claim with Border Patrol pursuant to the Federal\nTort Claims Act (FTCA). See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U. S. C. \u00a72675</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a). Accord-\ning to Boule, Agent Egbert retaliated against him while\n\f                   Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)              5\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthose claims were pending by reporting Boule\u2019s\n\u201cSMUGLER\u201d license plate to the Washington Department\nof Licensing for referencing illegal conduct, and by contact-\ning the Internal Revenue Service and prompting an audit\nof Boule\u2019s tax returns. Ultimately, Boule\u2019s FTCA claim was\ndenied and, after a year-long investigation, Border Patrol\ntook no action against Agent Egbert for his alleged use of\nforce or acts of retaliation. Thereafter, Agent Egbert con-\ntinued to serve as an active-duty Border Patrol agent.\n   In January 2017, Boule sued Agent Egbert in his individ-\nual capacity in Federal District Court, alleging a Fourth\nAmendment violation for excessive use of force and a First\nAmendment violation for unlawful retaliation. Boule in-\nvoked Bivens and asked the District Court to recognize a\ndamages action for each alleged constitutional violation.\nThe District Court declined to extend a Bivens remedy to\nBoule\u2019s claims and entered judgment for Agent Egbert. The\nCourt of Appeals reversed. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">998 F. 3d 370</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385 (CA9\n2021).

BOULE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nEgbert but against Border Patrol agents generally. The an-\nswer, plainly, is no. See Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 14) (refusing to extend Bivens into the \u201cfield\u201d of \u201cbor-\nder security\u201d).\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis betrays the pitfalls of ap-\nplying the special-factors analysis at too granular a level.\nThe court rested on three irrelevant distinctions from Her-\nn\u00e1ndez. First, Agent Egbert was several feet from (rather\nthan straddling) the border, but cross-border security is ob-\nviously implicated in either event. Second, Boule\u2019s guest\narrived in Seattle from New York rather than abroad, but\nan alien\u2019s port of entry does not make him less likely to be\na national-security threat. And third, Agent Egbert inves-\ntigated immigration violations on our side of the border, not\nCanada\u2019s, but immigration investigations in this country\nare perhaps more likely to impact the national security of\nthe United States. In short, the Court of Appeals offered no\nplausible basis to permit a Fourth Amendment Bivens\nclaim against Agent Egbert to proceed.\n                               2\n   Second, Congress has provided alternative remedies for\naggrieved parties in Boule\u2019s position that independently\nforeclose a Bivens action here. In Hern\u00e1ndez, we declined\nto authorize a Bivens remedy, in part, because the Execu-\ntive Branch already had investigated alleged misconduct by\nthe defendant Border Patrol agent. See 589 U.

As noted, Boule took ad-\nvantage of this grievance procedure, prompting a year-long\ninternal investigation into Agent Egbert\u2019s conduct. See su-\npra, at 4\u20135.\n   Boule nonetheless contends that Border Patrol\u2019s griev-\nance process is inadequate because he is not entitled to par-\nticipate and has no right to judicial review of an adverse\ndetermination.3 But we have never held that a Bivens al-\nternative must afford rights to participation or appeal.\nThat is so because Bivens \u201cis concerned solely with deter-\nring the unconstitutional acts of individual officers\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nthe focus is whether the Government has put in place safe-\nguards to \u201cpreven[t]\u201d constitutional violations \u201cfrom recur-\nring.\u201d Malesko, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118466\"><a href=\"/opinion/118466/correctional-services-corp-v-malesko/\">534 U.

So long as Con-\ngress or the Executive has created a remedial process that\nit finds sufficient to secure an adequate level of deterrence,\nthe courts cannot second-guess that calibration by superim-\nposing a Bivens remedy. That is true even if a court inde-\npendently concludes that the Government\u2019s procedures are\n\u201cnot as effective as an individual damages remedy.\u201d Bush,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Boule also argues that Agent Egbert forfeited any argument about\n\nBorder Patrol\u2019s grievance process because he did not raise the issue in\nthe Court of Appeals. We disagree. Because recognizing a Bivens cause\nof action \u201cis an extraordinary act that places great stress on the separa-\ntion of powers,\u201d Nestl\u00e9 USA, Inc. v. Doe, 593 U.

Thus here, as in Hern\u00e1ndez, we have no\nwarrant to doubt that the consideration of Boule\u2019s grievance\nagainst Agent Egbert secured adequate deterrence and af-\nforded Boule an alternative remedy. See 589 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 10).\n                               B\n   We also conclude that there is no Bivens cause of action\nfor Boule\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim. While we\nhave assumed that such a damages action might be availa-\nble, see, e.g., Hartman v.

Because a new context arises when there is a new\n\u201cconstitutional right at issue,\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 16), the Court of Appeals correctly held that Boule\u2019s\nFirst Amendment claim presents a new Bivens context. See\n998 F. 3d, at 390. Now presented with the question\nwhether to extend Bivens to this context, we hold that there\nis no Bivens action for First Amendment retaliation. There\nare many reasons to think that Congress, not the courts, is\nbetter suited to authorize such a damages remedy.\n   Recognizing any new Bivens action \u201centail[s] substantial\nsocial costs, including the risk that fear of personal mone-\ntary liability and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit of-\nficials in the discharge of their duties.\u201d Anderson v.\nCreighton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\">483 U.

Neither rationale has merit.\nFirst, just because plaintiffs often plead unlawful retalia-\ntion to establish a First Amendment violation is not a rea-\nson to afford them a cause of action to sue federal officers\nfor money damages.

In Boule\u2019s view, Passman, like\nthis case, permitted a damages action to proceed even\nthough it required the factfinder to probe a federal official\u2019s\nmotives for taking an adverse action against the plaintiff.\n  Even assuming the factual parallels are as close as Boule\nclaims, Passman carries little weight because it predates\nour current approach to implied causes of action and di-\nverges from the prevailing framework in three important\nways.

Initially, the Court told lower\ncourts to follow a \u201ctwo ste[p]\u201d inquiry before applying\nBivens to any new situation. Ante, at 7. At the first step, a\ncourt had to ask whether the case before it presented a \u201cnew\ncontext\u201d meaningfully different from Bivens. Ante, at 7. At\nthe second, a court had to consider whether \u201c \u2018special fac-\ntors\u2019 \u201d counseled hesitation before recognizing a new cause\nof action. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620697\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620697/alexander-v-sandoval/\">Ibid.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> But these tests soon produced their own set\nof questions: What distinguishes the first step from the sec-\nond? What makes a context \u201cnew\u201d or a factor \u201cspecial\u201d?\nAnd, most fundamentally, on what authority may courts\nrecognize new causes of action even under these standards?\n   Today, the Court helpfully answers some of these linger-\ning questions. It recognizes that our two-step inquiry really\nboils down to a \u201csingle question\u201d: Is there \u201cany reason to\n\f2                     EGBERT v.

But, respectfully,\nresolving that much only serves to highlight the larger re-\nmaining question: When might a court ever be \u201cbetter\nequipped\u201d than the people\u2019s elected representatives to\nweigh the \u201ccosts and benefits\u201d of creating a cause of action?\n    It seems to me that to ask the question is to answer it. To\ncreate a new cause of action is to assign new private rights\nand liabilities\u2014a power that is in every meaningful sense\nan act of legislation.

Weighing the costs and benefits of\nnew laws is the bread and butter of legislative committees.\nIt has no place in federal courts charged with deciding cases\nand controversies under existing law.\n    Instead of saying as much explicitly, however, the Court\nproceeds on to conduct a case-specific analysis. And there I\nconfess difficulties. The plaintiff is an American citizen\nwho argues that a federal law enforcement officer violated\nthe Fourth Amendment in searching the curtilage of his\nhome. Candidly, I struggle to see how this set of facts dif-\nfers meaningfully from those in Bivens itself. To be sure, as\nthe Court emphasizes, the episode here took place near an\ninternational border and the officer\u2019s search focused on vio-\nlations of the immigration laws. But why does that matter?\nThe Court suggests that Fourth Amendment violations\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             3\n\n               GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmatter less in this context because of \u201clikely\u201d national-secu-\nrity risks. Ante, at 11\u201312. So once more, we tote up for\nourselves the costs and benefits of a private right of action\nin this or that setting and reach a legislative judgment. To\natone for Bivens, it seems we continue repeating its most\nbasic mistake.\n   Of course, the Court\u2019s real messages run deeper than its\ncase-specific analysis. If the costs and benefits do not jus-\ntify a new Bivens action on facts so analogous to Bivens it-\nself, it\u2019s hard to see how they ever could. And if the only\nquestion is whether a court is \u201cbetter equipped\u201d than Con-\ngress to weigh the value of a new cause of action, surely the\nright answer will always be no. Doubtless, these are the\nlessons the Court seeks to convey. I would only take the\nnext step and acknowledge explicitly what the Court leaves\nbarely implicit. Sometimes, it seems, \u201cthis Court leaves a\ndoor ajar and holds out the possibility that someone, some-\nday might walk through it\u201d even as it devises a rule that\nensures \u201cno one . . . ever will.\u201d Edwards v.

The\nCourt goes to extraordinary lengths to avoid this result: It\nrewrites a legal standard it established just five years ago,\nstretches national-security concerns beyond recognition,\nand discerns an alternative remedial structure where none\nexists. The Court\u2019s innovations, taken together, enable it\nto close the door to Boule\u2019s claim and, presumably, to others\nthat fall squarely within Bivens\u2019 ambit.\n   Today\u2019s decision does not overrule Bivens. It neverthe-\nless contravenes precedent and will strip many more indi-\nviduals who suffer injuries at the hands of other federal of-\nficers, and whose circumstances are materially\nindistinguishable from those in Bivens, of an important\nremedy.

The\nCourt is therefore bound to draw all reasonable factual in-\nferences in favor of Boule. See Tolan v. Cotton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">572 U. S.\n650</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656\u2013657 (2014) (per curiam). Because the Court fails\nto do so, the factual record is described below in some detail,\nin the light our precedent requires.\n                              A\n  Boule is a U. S. citizen who owns, operates, and lives in a\nsmall bed-and-breakfast called the Smuggler\u2019s Inn in\nBlaine, Washington. The property line of the land on which\nthe inn is located touches the U. S.-Canada border. Shortly\nafter purchasing the property in 2000, Boule became aware\nthat people used his property to cross the border illegally in\nboth directions. Boule began serving as a paid, confidential\ninformant for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in\n2003 and for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\nin 2008. At the time of the events at issue in this case,\nBoule was still serving as an informant for ICE. ICE would\ncoordinate with CBP and other agencies based on the infor-\nmation Boule provided. Over the years, Boule provided in-\nformation leading to numerous arrests.\n  On the morning of March 20, 2014, petitioner Erik Eg-\nbert, a CBP agent, twice stopped Boule while Boule was\nrunning errands in town. Agent Egbert knew that Boule\nwas a long-time informant for ICE and that he had previ-\nously worked as an informant for CBP. Agent Egbert asked\nBoule about guests at the inn, and Boule advised him of a\nguest he expected to arrive that day from New York who\nhad flown in from Turkey the day before. Boule explained\nthat two of his employees were en route to pick the guest up\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U.

Agent Egbert\ncontinued patrolling in his CBP vehicle for the rest of the\nmorning but stayed near the inn so he would see when the\ncar carrying the guest returned. When it arrived, he fol-\nlowed the car into the driveway of the inn, passing a \u201cno\ntrespassing\u201d sign. Agent Egbert parked his vehicle behind\nthe arriving car in the driveway immediately adjacent to\nthe inn.\n  Agent Egbert exited his patrol vehicle and approached\nthe car. Boule\u2019s employee also exited the car; the guest re-\nmained inside. From the front porch of his inn, Boule asked\nAgent Egbert to leave. When Agent Egbert refused, Boule\nstepped off the porch, positioned himself between Agent Eg-\nbert and the vehicle, and explained that the person in the\ncar was a guest who had come from New York to Seattle\nand who had been through security at the airport. Boule\nagain asked Agent Egbert to leave. Agent Egbert grabbed\nBoule by his chest, lifted him up, and shoved him against\nthe vehicle and then threw him to the ground. Boule landed\non his hip and shoulder.\n  Agent Egbert opened the car door and asked the guest\nabout his immigration status. Boule called 911 to request\na supervisor; Agent Egbert relayed the same request over\nhis radio. Several minutes later, a supervisor and another\nagent arrived at the inn. After concluding that the guest\nwas lawfully in the country (just as Boule had previously\ninformed Agent Egbert), the three officers departed. Boule\nlater sought medical treatment for his injuries.\n  Boule complained to Agent Egbert\u2019s superiors about the\nincident and filed an administrative claim with CBP, which\nallegedly prompted Agent Egbert to retaliate against Boule.\nAgent Egbert contacted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),\nthe Social Security Administration, the Washington State\nDepartment of Licensing, and the Whatcom County Asses-\nsor\u2019s Office, asking them to investigate Boule\u2019s business.\nThese agencies did so, but none found that Boule had done\n\f4                      EGBERT v.

Applying the two-\nstep framework set forth in those cases, the Court of Ap-\npeals\u2019 determination that Boule\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim\nis cognizable under Bivens should be affirmed for two inde-\npendent reasons. First, Boule\u2019s claim does not present a\nnew context. Second, even if it did, no special factors would\ncounsel hesitation.\n                              1\n   Boule\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim does not arise in a new\ncontext. Bivens itself involved a U. S. citizen bringing a\nFourth Amendment claim against individual, rank-and-file\nfederal law enforcement officers who allegedly violated his\nconstitutional rights within the United States by entering\nhis property without a warrant and using excessive force.\nThose are precisely the facts of Boule\u2019s complaint.\n   The only arguably salient difference in \u201ccontext\u201d between\nthis case and Bivens is that the defendants in Bivens were\nemployed at the time by the (now-defunct) Federal Bureau\nof Narcotics, while Agent Egbert was employed by CBP. As\ndiscussed, however, this Court\u2019s precedent instructs that\nsome differences are too \u201ctrivial . . . to create a new Bivens\ncontext.\u201d Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26).2 That it\nwas a CBP agent rather than a Federal Bureau of Narcotics\nagent who unlawfully entered Boule\u2019s property and used\nconstitutionally excessive force against him plainly is not\nthe sort of \u201cmeaningful\u201d distinction that our new-context in-\nquiry is designed to weed out. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ibid.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Egbert argues in passing that the fact that he was operating under a\n\n\u201c \u2018statutory . . . mandate\u2019 not invoked in prior cases,\u201d standing alone,\n\u201cdooms [Boule\u2019s] no-new-context argument.\u201d Reply Brief 19 (quoting\nZiglar, 582 U.

Indeed, if\nthe \u201cnew context\u201d inquiry were defined at such a fine level\nof granularity, every case would raise a new context, be-\ncause the Federal Bureau of Narcotics no longer exists.

That case involved an Eighth Amendment\nclaim brought by a federal prisoner against a private corpo-\nration under contract with the federal Bureau of Prisons.\nThe Court observed that \u201cthe threat of suit against an indi-\nvidual\u2019s employer,\u201d rather than \u201cthe individual directly re-\nsponsible for the alleged injury,\u201d \u201cwas not the kind of deter-\nrence contemplated by Bivens.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118466\"><a href=\"/opinion/118466/correctional-services-corp-v-malesko/\">Id.,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 70\u201371.

The Court therefore determined\nthat in the military sphere, the special-factors analysis\nshould be applied somewhat more broadly than the re-\nspondent urged. Id., at 681. Stanley, in other words, re-\nflected the Court\u2019s longstanding approach to Bivens cases:\nconsidering the facts and the substantive context of each\ncase and determining whether special factors counseled\nhesitation.

Florida\u2019s Medicaid agency paid $862,688.77 to\n  cover Gallardo\u2019s initial medical expenses, and the agency continues to\n  pay her medical expenses. Gallardo, through her parents, sued the\n  truck\u2019s owner and driver, as well as the Lee County School Board. She\n  sought compensation for past medical expenses, future medical ex-\n  penses, lost earnings, and other damages. That litigation resulted in\n  a settlement for $800,000, with $35,367.52 expressly designated as\n  compensation for past medical expenses. The settlement did not spe-\n  cifically allocate any amount for future medical expenses.\n     The Medicaid Act requires participating States to pay for certain\n  needy individuals\u2019 medical costs and then to make reasonable efforts\n  to recoup those costs from liable third parties.            42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A). Under Florida\u2019s Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act,\n  a beneficiary like Gallardo who \u201caccept[s] medical assistance\u201d from\n  Medicaid \u201cautomatically assigns to the [state] agency any right\u201d to\n  third-party payments for medical care. Fla. Stat. \u00a7409.910(6)(b). Ap-\n  plied to Gallardo\u2019s settlement, Florida\u2019s statutory framework entitled\n  the State to $300,000\u2014i.e., 37.5% of $800,000, the percentage the stat-\n  ute sets as presumptively representing the portion of the tort recovery\n  that is for \u201cpast and future medical expenses,\u201d absent clear and con-\n  vincing rebuttal evidence. \u00a7\u00a7409.910(11)(f )(1), (17)(b). Gallardo chal-\n  lenged the presumptive allocation in an administrative proceeding.\n\f2                     GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    She also brought this lawsuit seeking a declaration that Florida was\n    violating the Medicaid Act by trying to recover from portions of the\n    settlement compensating for future medical expenses. The Eleventh\n    Circuit concluded that the relevant Medicaid Act provisions do not pre-\n    vent a State from seeking reimbursement from settlement monies al-\n    located for future medical care. 963 F. 3d 1167, 1178.\nHeld: The Medicaid Act permits a State to seek reimbursement from set-\n tlement payments allocated for future medical care. Pp. 5\u201312.\n    (a) Gallardo argues that the Medicaid Act\u2019s anti-lien provision\u2014\n which prohibits States from recovering medical payments from a ben-\n eficiary\u2019s \u201cproperty,\u201d \u00a71396p(a)(1)\u2014forecloses recovery from settle-\n ment amounts other than those allocated for past medical care paid for\n by Medicaid. But this Court has held that the provision does not apply\n to state laws \u201cexpressly authorized by the terms of \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25) and\n 1396k(a)\u201d of the Medicaid Act. Arkansas Dept. of Health and Human\n Servs. v. Ahlborn, 547 U. S. 268, 284. Here, Florida\u2019s Medicaid Third-\n Party Liability Act\u2014under which Florida may seek reimbursement\n from settlement amounts representing \u201cpayment for medical care,\u201d\n past or future\u2014\u201cis expressly authorized by the terms of . . .\n [\u00a7]1396k(a)\u201d and thus falls squarely within the \u201cexception to the anti-\n lien provision\u201d that this Court has recognized. Ibid.\n    The plain text of \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) decides this case. Nothing in\n \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) limits a beneficiary\u2019s assignment to payments for past\n \u201cmedical care\u201d already paid for by Medicaid. To the contrary, the grant\n of \u201cany rights . . . to payment for medical care\u201d most naturally covers\n not only rights to payment for past medical expenses, but also rights\n to payment for future medical expenses. \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A); see United\n States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5. The relevant distinction is thus \u201cbe-\n tween medical and nonmedical expenses,\u201d Wos v. E. M. A., 568 U. S.\n 627, 641, not between past and future medical expenses.\n    Statutory context reinforces that \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cpay-\n ment for medical care\u201d is not limited as Gallardo suggests. For exam-\n ple, when the Medicaid Act separately requires state plans to comply\n with \u00a71396k, it describes that provision as imposing a \u201cmandatory as-\n signment of rights of payment for medical support and other medical\n care owed to recipients.\u201d \u00a71396a(a)(45) (emphasis added). Section\n 1396a(a)(45) thus distinguishes only between medical and nonmedical\n care, not between past (paid) medical care payments and future (un-\n paid) medical care payments. If Congress had intended to draw such\n a distinction, \u201cit easily could have drafted language to that effect.\u201d\n Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp., 571 U. S. 161, 169. In\n fact, Congress did include more limiting language elsewhere in the\n Medicaid Act. Section 1396a(a)(25)(H), which requires States to enact\n\f                   Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nlaws granting themselves automatic rights to certain third-party pay-\nments, contains precisely the limitation that Gallardo would read into\nthe assignment provision. Thus, if \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\u2019s broad language\nalone were not dispositive, its contrast with the limiting language in\n\u00a71396a(a)(25)(H) would be. Pp. 5\u20137.\n   (b) Gallardo\u2019s arguments that \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) has a different mean-\ning are unconvincing. Gallardo construes the prefatory clause to\n\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\u2014 which provides that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the assignment\nprovision is to \u201cassis[t] in the collection of medical support payments\nand other payments for medical care owed to recipients of medical as-\nsistance under the State plan\u201d\u2014to limit the assignment provision to\npayments that are already \u201cowed\u201d for \u201cpast medical care provided un-\nder the [state] plan.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 30. But the prefatory clause\ndefines to whom the third-party payments are \u201cowed\u201d\u2014\u201crecipients of\nmedical assistance under the State plan.\u201d It does not specify the pur-\npose for which those payments must be made, referring to \u201cmedical\nsupport\u201d and \u201cmedical care\u201d payments, consistent with the adjacent\nlanguage in \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A).\n   Gallardo also proposes that the Court read the assignment provision\nto incorporate the more limited language in \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H). But the\nCourt must give effect to, not nullify, Congress\u2019 choice to include lim-\niting language in some provisions but not others, see Russello v. United\nStates, 464 U. S. 16, 23. Ahlborn, which Gallardo contends eliminated\nany daylight between \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H) and \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), was clear\nthat these two provisions \u201cech[o]\u201d or \u201creinforc[e]\u201d each other insofar as\nthey both involve \u201crecovery of payments for medical care,\u201d 547 U. S.,\nat 282, and not \u201cpayment for, for example, lost wages,\u201d id., at 280. Ahl-\nborn did not suggest that these provisions must be interpreted in lock-\nstep. Gallardo\u2019s idea that one of these two complementary provisions\nmust \u201cprevail\u201d over the other is therefore mistaken. The complemen-\ntary provisions concern different requirements; they do not conflict\njust because one is broader than the other.\n   Gallardo and the United States also argue that \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\nshould be interpreted consistently with \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and (B),\nwhich require a State to seek reimbursement \u201cto the extent of \u201d a third\nparty\u2019s liability \u201cfor care and services available under the plan.\u201d But\nthe relevant language\u2014\u201cpay[ment] for care and services available un-\nder the plan\u201d\u2014could just as readily refer to payment for medical care\n\u201cavailable\u201d in the future. Regardless, Congress did not use this lan-\nguage to define the scope of an assignment under \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), im-\nplying again that the provisions should not be interpreted the same\nway. This implication is strengthened by the fact that \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\nwas enacted after \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and (B), and Congress did not use\nthe existing language in \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and (B) to define the scope\n\f4                      GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    of the mandatory assignment.\n        Finally, Gallardo\u2019s two policy arguments for her preferred interpre-\n    tation both fail. First, citing a footnote from Ahlborn, she contends\n    that it would be \u201c \u2018absurd and fundamentally unjust\u2019 \u201d for a State to\n    \u201c \u2018share in damages for which it has provided no compensation.\u2019 \u201d 547\n    U. S., at 288, n. 19. But the Court\u2019s holding there was dictated by the\n    Medicaid Act\u2019s \u201ctext,\u201d not by the Court\u2019s sense of fairness. Id., at 280.\n    Second, Gallardo speculates that the Court\u2019s reading of\n    \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) would authorize a \u201clifetime assignment\u201d covering not\n    only the rights an individual has while a Medicaid beneficiary but also\n    any rights acquired in the future when the individual is no longer a\n    Medicaid beneficiary. Not so. The provision is most naturally read as\n    covering those rights \u201cthe individual\u201d possesses while on Medicaid.\n    And given background legal principles about the scope of assignments,\n    \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) cannot be read to cover the sort of \u201clifetime assign-\n    ment\u201d Gallardo invokes.

SIMONE MARSTILLER, IN HER OFFICIAL CAPACITY\n   AS SECRETARY OF THE FLORIDA AGENCY FOR\n         HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATION\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                                   [June 6, 2022]\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Medicaid requires participating States to pay for certain\nneedy individuals\u2019 medical costs and then to make reason-\nable efforts to recoup those costs from liable third parties.\nConsequently, a State must require Medicaid beneficiaries\nto assign the State \u201cany rights . . . to payment for medical\ncare from any third party.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A).\nThat assignment permits a State to seek reimbursement\nfrom the portion of a beneficiary\u2019s private tort settlement\nthat represents \u201cpayment for medical care,\u201d ibid., despite\nthe Medicaid Act\u2019s general prohibition against seeking re-\nimbursement from a beneficiary\u2019s \u201cproperty,\u201d \u00a71396p(a)(1).\nThe question presented is whether \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) permits\na State to seek reimbursement from settlement payments\nallocated for future medical care. We conclude that it does.\n\f2                 GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n                               A\n    States participating in Medicaid \u201cmust comply with [the\nMedicaid Act\u2019s] requirements\u201d or risk losing Medicaid fund-\ning. Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 301 (1980); see 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71396c. Most relevant here, the Medicaid Act re-\nquires a State to condition Medicaid eligibility on a benefi-\nciary\u2019s assignment to the State of \u201cany rights . . . to support\n. . . for the purpose of medical care\u201d and to \u201cpayment for\nmedical care from any third party.\u201d \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A); see\nalso \u00a71396a(a)(45) (mandating States\u2019 compliance with\n\u00a71396k). The State must also enact laws by which it auto-\nmatically acquires a right to certain third-party payments\n\u201cfor health care items or services furnished\u201d to a benefi-\nciary. \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H). And the State must use these (and\nother) tools to \u201cseek reimbursement\u201d from third parties \u201cto\nthe extent of [their] legal liability\u201d for a beneficiary\u2019s \u201ccare\nand services available under the plan.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A)\u2013\n(B).\n    The Medicaid Act also sets a limit on States\u2019 efforts to re-\ncover their expenses. The Act\u2019s \u201canti-lien provision\u201d prohib-\nits States from recovering medical payments from a benefi-\nciary\u2019s \u201cproperty.\u201d \u00a71396p(a)(1); see also \u00a71396a(a)(18)\n(requiring state Medicaid plans to comply with \u00a71396p).\nBecause a \u201cbeneficiary has a property right in the proceeds\nof [any] settlement,\u201d the anti-lien provision protects settle-\nments from States\u2019 reimbursement efforts absent some\nstatutory exception. Wos v. E. M. A., 568 U. S. 627, 633\n(2013). State laws \u201crequir[ing] an assignment of the right\n. . . to receive payments [from third parties] for medical\ncare,\u201d as \u201cexpressly authorized by the terms of\n\u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25) and 1396k(a),\u201d are one such exception. Ar-\nkansas Dept. of Health and Human Servs. v. Ahlborn, 547\nU. S. 268, 284 (2006). Accordingly, a State may seek reim-\nbursement from the portion of a settlement designated for\nthe \u201cmedical care\u201d described in those provisions; otherwise,\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

Id., at\n285.\n                              B\n   To satisfy its Medicaid obligations, Florida has enacted\nits Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act, which directs the\nState\u2019s Medicaid agency to \u201cseek reimbursement from\nthird-party benefits to the limit of legal liability and for the\nfull amount of third-party benefits, but not in excess of the\namount of medical assistance paid by Medicaid.\u201d Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7409.910(4) (2017).1 To this end, the statute provides that\nwhen a beneficiary \u201caccept[s] medical assistance\u201d from\nMedicaid, the beneficiary \u201cautomatically assigns to the\n[state] agency any right\u201d to third-party payments for medi-\ncal care. \u00a7409.910(6)(b). A lien \u201cfor the full amount of med-\nical assistance provided\u201d then \u201cattaches automatically\u201d to\nany settlements related to an injury \u201cthat necessitated that\nMedicaid provide medical assistance.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7409.910(6)(c),\n(6)(c)(1), 409.901(7)(a).\n   Rather than permit the State to recover from a benefi-\nciary\u2019s entire settlement, the statute entitles Florida to half\na beneficiary\u2019s total recovery, after deducting 25% for attor-\nney\u2019s fees and costs (i.e., 37.5% of the total).            See\n\u00a7409.910(11)(f )(1). This amount presumptively represents\nthe portion of the tort recovery that is for \u201cpast and future\nmedical expenses.\u201d \u00a7409.910(17)(b). Beneficiaries can re-\nbut that presumption by proving with clear and convincing\nevidence \u201cthat the portion of the total recovery which\nshould be allocated as past and future medical expenses is\nless than the amount calculated by [Florida\u2019s] formula.\u201d\nIbid.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For the sake of simplicity, we refer to the State, its Medicaid agency,\n\nor simply Medicaid interchangeably.\n\f4                GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               C\n  In 2008, a truck struck then-13-year-old petitioner Gia-\nninna Gallardo after she stepped off her school bus. Gal-\nlardo suffered catastrophic injuries and remains in a per-\nsistent vegetative state. Florida\u2019s Medicaid agency paid\n$862,688.77 to cover her initial medical expenses, after\nWellCare of Florida, a private insurer, paid $21,499.30. As\na condition of receiving Medicaid assistance, Gallardo had\nassigned Florida her right to recover from third parties. Be-\ncause Gallardo is permanently disabled, Medicaid contin-\nues to pay her medical expenses.\n  Gallardo, through her parents, sued the truck\u2019s owner\nand driver, as well as the Lee County School Board, seeking\ncompensation for past medical expenses, future medical ex-\npenses, lost earnings, and other damages. Although Gal-\nlardo sought over $20 million in damages, the litigation ul-\ntimately settled for $800,000\u2014a 4% recovery.             The\nsettlement expressly designated $35,367.52 of that amount\nas compensation for past medical expenses\u20144% of the\n$884,188.07 paid by Medicaid and WellCare. The settle-\nment also recognized that \u201csome portion of th[e] settlement\nmay represent compensation for future medical expenses,\u201d\nApp. 29, but did not specifically allocate any amount for fu-\nture medical expenses.\n  Under Florida\u2019s statutory formula, the State was pre-\nsumptively entitled to $300,000 of Gallardo\u2019s settlement\n(37.5% of $800,000). Gallardo, citing the settlement\u2019s ex-\nplicit allocation of only $35,367.52 as compensation for past\nmedical expenses, asked Florida what amount it would ac-\ncept to satisfy its Medicaid lien. When Florida did not re-\nspond, Gallardo put $300,000 in escrow and challenged the\npresumptive allocation in an administrative proceeding.\nThere, Florida defended the presumptive allocation be-\ncause, in its view, it could seek reimbursement from settle-\nment payments for past and future medical expenses, and\nso was not limited to recovering the portion Gallardo had\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nallocated for past expenses.\n   While the administrative proceeding was ongoing, Gal-\nlardo brought this lawsuit seeking a declaration that Flor-\nida was violating the Medicaid Act by trying to recover from\nportions of the settlement compensating for future medical\nexpenses. The U. S. District Court for the Northern District\nof Florida granted Gallardo summary judgment. See Gal-\nlardo v. Dudeck, 263 F. Supp. 3d 1247, 1260 (2017). The\nEleventh Circuit reversed, concluding that \u201cthe text and\nstructure of the federal Medicaid statutes do not conflict\nwith Florida law\u201d because they \u201conly prohibit a State from\nasserting a lien against any part of a settlement not \u2018desig-\nnated as payments for medical care.\u2019 \u201d Gallardo v. Dudeck,\n963 F. 3d 1167, 1176 (2020) (quoting Ahlborn, 547 U. S., at\n284). The Eleventh Circuit explained that the relevant\nMedicaid Act provisions \u201cd[o] not in any way prohibit [a\nState] from seeking reimbursement from settlement mon-\nies for medical care allocated to future care.\u201d 963 F. 3d, at\n1178 (emphasis deleted). Judge Wilson dissented, contend-\ning that the Medicaid Act \u201climit[s] the state to the part of\nthe recovery that represents payment for past medical\ncare.\u201d Id., at 1184.\n   Because the Supreme Court of Florida came to the oppo-\nsite conclusion of the Eleventh Circuit, see Giraldo v.\nAgency for Health Care Admin., 248 So. 3d 53, 56 (2018), we\ngranted certiorari, 594 U. S. ___ (2021).\n                              II\n  Gallardo argues that the Eleventh Circuit erred by per-\nmitting Florida to seek reimbursement for medical ex-\npenses from settlement amounts representing payment for\nfuture medical care. According to Gallardo, the Medicaid\nAct\u2019s anti-lien provision in \u00a71396p forecloses recovery from\nsettlement amounts other than those allocated for past\nmedical care paid for by Medicaid. Thus, Gallardo con-\ncludes, the anti-lien provision preempts any state law that\n\f6                 GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npermits additional recovery.\n  We disagree. Under \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), Florida may seek\nreimbursement from settlement amounts representing\n\u201cpayment for medical care,\u201d past or future. Thus, because\nFlorida\u2019s assignment statute \u201cis expressly authorized by the\nterms of . . . [\u00a7]1396k(a),\u201d it falls squarely within the \u201cex-\nception to the anti-lien provision\u201d that this Court has rec-\nognized. Ahlborn, 547 U. S., at 284.\n                                 A\n  The plain text of \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) decides this case. This\nprovision requires the State to acquire from each Medicaid\nbeneficiary an assignment of \u201cany rights . . . of the individ-\nual . . . to support . . . for the purpose of medical care . . .\nand to payment for medical care from any third party.\u201d\n\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A). Nothing in this provision purports to limit\na beneficiary\u2019s assignment to \u201cpayment for\u201d past \u201cmedical\ncare\u201d already paid for by Medicaid. To the contrary, the\ngrant of \u201cany rights . . . to payment for medical care\u201d most\nnaturally covers not only rights to payment for past medical\nexpenses, but also rights to payment for future medical ex-\npenses. Ibid. (emphasis added); see United States v. Gon-\nzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997) (\u201c[T]he word \u2018any\u2019 has an expan-\nsive meaning\u201d). The relevant distinction is thus \u201cbetween\nmedical and nonmedical expenses,\u201d Wos, 568 U. S., at 641,\nnot between past expenses Medicaid has paid and future\nexpenses it has not.\n  Statutory context reinforces that \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\u2019s refer-\nence to \u201cpayment for medical care\u201d is not limited as Gal-\nlardo suggests. First, when \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) limits the kind\nof \u201csupport\u201d (e.g., child support) covered by a beneficiary\u2019s\nassignment, the statute does not single out support allo-\ncated for past expenses that a State has already paid. In-\nstead, it requires only that support payments be \u201cspecified\nas support for the purpose of medical care\u201d generally.\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Second, when the Med-\nicaid Act separately requires state plans to comply with\n\u00a71396k, it describes that provision as imposing a \u201cmanda-\ntory assignment of rights of payment for medical support\nand other medical care owed to recipients.\u201d \u00a71396a(a)(45)\n(emphasis added).          In short, \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) and\n\u00a71396a(a)(45) distinguish only between medical and non-\nmedical care, not between past (paid) medical care pay-\nments and future (unpaid) medical care payments. If Con-\ngress had intended to draw such a distinction, \u201cit easily\ncould have drafted language to that effect.\u201d Mississippi\nex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp., 571 U. S. 161, 169\n(2014).\n   In fact, Congress did include such limiting language else-\nwhere in the Medicaid Act. Section 1396a(a)(25)(H), which\nrequires States to enact laws granting themselves auto-\nmatic rights to certain third-party payments, contains pre-\ncisely the limitation that Gallardo would read into the as-\nsignment provision. That provision applies only when\n\u201cpayment has been made under the State plan for medical\nassistance for health care items or services furnished to an\nindividual,\u201d and covers only third-party payments \u201cfor such\nhealth care items or services.\u201d \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H) (emphasis\nadded). Thus, if \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\u2019s broad language alone\nwere not dispositive, its contrast with the limiting language\nin \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H) would be. \u201cHad Congress intended to\nrestrict\u201d \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) to past expenses Medicaid has\npaid, it \u201cwould have done so expressly as it did in\u201d\n\u00a71396a(a)(25)(H). Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16,\n23 (1983).\n   In sum, because the plain meaning of \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), in-\nformed by statutory context, allows Florida to seek reim-\nbursement from settlement amounts representing past or\nfuture \u201cpayments for medical care,\u201d Florida\u2019s assignment\n\f8                    GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprovision falls within the \u201cexception to the anti-lien provi-\nsion.\u201d Ahlborn, 547 U. S., at 284.2\n                              B\n   Gallardo nevertheless argues that \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) has a\ndifferent meaning, largely by discounting the text of\n\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) and then relying on other differently\nworded provisions or on policy arguments, none of which we\nfind convincing.\n   Insofar as she confronts \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) itself, Gallardo\nlargely focuses on its prefatory clause, which provides that\nthe \u201cpurpose\u201d of the assignment provision is to \u201cassis[t] in\nthe collection of medical support payments and other pay-\nments for medical care owed to recipients of medical assis-\ntance under the State plan.\u201d \u00a71396k(a). Gallardo construes\nthis language to limit the assignment provision to pay-\nments that are already \u201cowed\u201d for \u201cpast medical care pro-\nvided under the [state] plan.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 30.\n   Gallardo\u2019s argument misreads the statutory text. The\nprefatory clause does not refer to payments \u201cowed\u201d \u201cunder\nthe State plan,\u201d but rather to \u201cpayments owed to recipients\nof medical assistance under the State plan.\u201d \u00a71396k(a) (em-\nphasis added). In other words, the prefatory language Gal-\nlardo invokes defines to whom the third-party payments are\n\u201cowed\u201d\u2014\u201crecipients of medical assistance under the State\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 According to the dissent, our conclusion conflicts with the \u201cback-\n\nground principl[e] of insurance law\u201d that an insurer\u2019s third-party recov-\nery is limited \u201c \u2018to the same elements as those for which [the insurer] has\nmade payment.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 9 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (quoting 16 S.\nPlitt, D. Maldonado, J. Rogers, & J. Plitt, Couch on Insurance \u00a7226:36\n(3d ed. 2021)). But even assuming this principle is relevant as the dis-\nsent supposes, the dissent concedes that it gives way if a \u201ccontractual\nter[m]\u201d\u2014an assignment provision, for example\u2014permits a broader re-\ncovery. Post, at 9; see also, e.g., 16 Couch on Insurance \u00a7222:63 (citing\nexamples). Here, \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) mandates an assignment provision\nthat does just that.\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplan.\u201d It does not specify the purpose for which those pay-\nments must be made. On that score, the prefatory clause\nrefers to \u201cmedical support\u201d and \u201cmedical care\u201d payments,\nconsistent with the adjacent language in \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A).\n  With little support in the text of \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), Gal-\nlardo proposes that we read the assignment provision to in-\ncorporate \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H)\u2019s more limited language. But as\nexplained above, see supra, at 7, we must give effect to, not\nnullify, Congress\u2019 choice to include limiting language in\nsome provisions but not others, see Russello, 464 U. S., at\n23. Gallardo responds that our decision in Ahlborn elimi-\nnated any daylight between \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H) and\n\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), because we said there that these provi-\nsions \u201creiterat[e],\u201d \u201creinforc[e],\u201d and \u201cech[o]\u201d each other.\n547 U. S., at 276, 280, 281. But Ahlborn was clear that\nthese two provisions \u201cech[o]\u201d or \u201creinforc[e]\u201d each other in-\nsofar as they both involve \u201crecovery of payments for medical\ncare,\u201d id., at 282, and not \u201cpayment for, for example, lost\nwages,\u201d id., at 280. Ahlborn did not suggest that we must\notherwise interpret these provisions in lockstep.\n  Conceding the provisions\u2019 scope could differ, Gallardo ar-\ngues that the later enacted \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H) should \u201cpre-\nvai[l]\u201d over the earlier enacted \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A). Brief for\nPetitioner 34. But Gallardo does not identify any conflict\nrequiring one of the provisions to prevail. Both provisions\nrequire the State to obtain rights\u2014either by assignment or\nby statute\u2014to certain third-party payments. Because they\nconcern different requirements, they do not conflict just be-\ncause one is broader in scope than the other. In fact, the\nprovisions complement each other. Section 1396k(a)(1)(A)\nprovides a broad, but not foolproof, contractual right to\nthird-party payments for medical care. See Brief for Re-\nspondent 33\u201334 (explaining circumstances when an assign-\nment under \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) might be ineffective). By con-\ntrast, \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H) provides a more targeted statutory\nright for when the assignment might fail. See Brief for\n\f10                   GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 28\u201329 (explaining that,\nprior to \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H)\u2019s enactment, insurers were\n\u201cthwarting [\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)] by refusing to recognize as-\nsignments and arguing that their insurance contracts for-\nbade assignments\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).3\nThus, the idea that one of these two complementary provi-\nsions must \u201cprevail\u201d over the other is mistaken.\n   Gallardo and the United States also invoke\n\u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and (B), which require States to \u201ctake all\nreasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third\nparties . . . to pay for care and services available under the\n[Medicaid] plan\u201d and to \u201cseek reimbursement . . . to the ex-\ntent of such legal liability.\u201d They argue that these provi-\nsions are the Medicaid Act\u2019s \u201cmain\u201d or \u201canchor\u201d third-party\nliability provisions and limit the State\u2019s recovery under any\nother provision \u201cto the extent of \u201d a third party\u2019s payments\n\u201cfor care and services available under the plan,\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A)\u2013(B), which they interpret to include only\npayments for medical care that Medicaid has already cov-\nered. Reply Brief 6 (internal quotation marks omitted); see\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18.\n   This argument suffers from several problems. To begin,\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The United States makes a similar argument when it relies on\n\n\u00a71396a(a)(25)(I)(ii), under which States must enact laws requiring\nhealth insurers to \u201caccept the State\u2019s right of recovery and the assign-\nment to the State of any right of an individual or other entity to payment\nfrom the party for an item or service for which payment has been made\nunder the State plan.\u201d We disagree that this provision \u201csuggests that\nCongress understood the assignment of rights under Section 1396k to be\nlimited to third-party payments for services covered by Medicaid.\u201d Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 19. Like \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H), this pro-\nvision targets specific attempts by health insurers to avoid making pay-\nments to state Medicaid programs. Its narrower focus on health insur-\ners, who typically pay only once medical services are rendered, explains\nits application to a narrower category of third-party payments, and says\nlittle to nothing about the meaning of \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\u2019s broader scope.\n\f                    Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nit is far from clear that \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and (B) refer only\nto past expenses the State has already paid. The relevant\nlanguage\u2014\u201cpay[ment] for care and services available under\nthe plan\u201d\u2014could just as readily refer to payment for medi-\ncal care \u201cavailable\u201d in the future. Regardless, even if this\nlanguage means what Gallardo says it does, Congress did\nnot use this language to define the scope of an assignment\nunder \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), implying again that the provisions\nshould not be interpreted the same way. See supra, at 7.\nThis implication is strengthened by the fact that\n\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) was enacted after \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and\n(B). It would have been easy for Congress to use the exist-\ning language in \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and (B) to define the\nscope of the mandatory assignment. But it did not.4\n   Finally, Gallardo relies on two policy arguments for her\npreferred interpretation. First, citing a footnote from Ahl-\nborn, she contends that it would be \u201c \u2018absurd and fundamen-\ntally unjust\u2019 \u201d for a State to \u201c \u2018share in damages for which it\nhas provided no compensation.\u2019 \u201d 547 U. S., at 288, n. 19\n(quoting Flanigan v. Department of Labor and Industry,\n123 Wash. 2d 418, 426, 869 P. 2d 14, 17 (1994)). Although\nAhlborn noted possible unfairness if States were given \u201cab-\nsolute priority\u201d to collect from the entirety of a tort settle-\nment, 547 U. S., at 288, our holding there was dictated by\nthe Medicaid Act\u2019s \u201ctext,\u201d not by our sense of fairness, id.,\nat 280. Had the text of the Medicaid Act authorized \u201cabso-\nlute priority,\u201d Ahlborn would have been decided differently.\n   Second, Gallardo speculates that our reading of\n\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) would authorize a \u201clifetime assignment\u201d\ncovering not only the rights an individual has while he is a\nMedicaid beneficiary but also any rights he acquires in the\nfuture when he is no longer a Medicaid beneficiary.

Section 1396k(a)(1)(A) only as-\nsigns \u201cany rights . . . of the individual\u201d (emphasis added),\nwhich is most naturally read as covering those rights \u201cthe\nindividual\u201d possesses while on Medicaid. We must also\nread \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\u2019s text in light of background legal prin-\nciples, and it is blackletter law that assignments typically\ncover \u201conly [those] rights possessed by the assignors at the\ntime of the assignments,\u201d United States v.

These\nprovisions constitute a limited exception to the Act\u2019s default\nrule prohibiting a State from imposing a lien against the\nbeneficiary\u2019s property or seeking to use any of that property\nto reimburse itself. Accordingly, a State may claim portions\nof the beneficiary\u2019s tort award or settlement representing\npayments for the beneficiary\u2019s medical care, but not those\nrepresenting other compensation to the beneficiary (e.g.,\ndamages for lost wages or pain and suffering). Arkansas\nDept. of Health and Human Servs. v. Ahlborn, 547 U. S.\n268, 282\u2013286 (2006).

The Court does so by reading one statutory provision\nin isolation while giving short shrift to the statutory con-\ntext, the relationships between the provisions at issue, and\nthe framework set forth in precedent. The Court\u2019s holding\nis inconsistent with the structure of the Medicaid program\nand will cause needless unfairness and disruption. I re-\nspectfully dissent.\n                              I\n  Congress conditions a State\u2019s receipt of federal Medicaid\nfunding, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396d(b), on compliance with fed-\neral requirements for the program. The Court today details\nat length one of these requirements: that a state Medicaid\nplan pursue reimbursement for the State\u2019s payments where\nreimbursement is available from a third party. See ante, at\n1\u20133. It devotes comparatively little attention to another\ncentral requirement: that a State not assert claims against\nthe property of Medicaid beneficiaries or recipients.\n  Under the Medicaid Act\u2019s anti-lien provision, enacted in\n1965 as part of the original Act, \u201c[n]o lien may be imposed\nagainst the property of any individual prior to his death on\naccount of medical assistance\u201d provided under the state\nMedicaid plan, whether \u201cpaid or to be paid.\u201d \u00a71396p(a)(1);\nsee Ahlborn, 547 U.

In addition, the Act\u2019s\nanti-recovery provision, also enacted in 1965, provides that\n\u201c[n]o adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance cor-\nrectly paid on behalf of an individual under the State plan\nmay be made.\u201d \u00a71396p(b)(1). Together, the anti-lien and\nanti-recovery provisions establish that acceptance of Medi-\ncaid does not render a beneficiary indebted to the State or\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

If a Medicaid benefi-\nciary\u2019s financial circumstances change and a beneficiary\ngains the ability to pay for his or her own medical expenses,\nthe beneficiary is not obligated to repay the State for past\nexpenses, no matter the magnitude of the change in circum-\nstances. Rather, the ordinary consequence is that the indi-\nvidual simply becomes ineligible for benefits moving for-\nward.1\n   In Ahlborn, this Court held that the Medicaid provisions\nenabling the State to seek reimbursement from third par-\nties liable for a beneficiary\u2019s medical care (discussed in de-\ntail below) establish a narrow exception to the anti-lien pro-\nvision. The exception applies where the beneficiary directly\nsues a tortfeasor for payment of medical costs.2 As a thresh-\nold matter, the Court held that a beneficiary\u2019s settlement\nproceeds qualified as beneficiary \u201cproperty\u201d protected by\nthe anti-lien provision unless an exception to that provision\napplied. Id., at 285\u2013286. The Court further held that Med-\nicaid\u2019s assignment to the State of rights to reimbursement\nfrom third parties \u201ccarved out\u201d an \u201cexception to the anti-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Petitioner Gianinna Gallardo has continued to receive Medicaid ben-\n\nefits, despite the proceeds from her tort settlement, because those pro-\nceeds were transferred into a congressionally authorized Special Needs\nTrust, a narrow exception to Medicaid\u2019s asset limits. See Reply Brief 22,\nn. 6. Such a trust exists to pay expenses not covered by Medicaid, which\nmay include, for example, certain home nursing care or a home ramp for\na wheelchair. Upon a beneficiary\u2019s death, all trust assets are transferred\nto the State until the State is fully reimbursed for all medical assistance\nit has furnished.

S. 268, 280, n. 9 (2006); see also id., at 281 (\u201cassuming\u201d that\none of these provisions, \u00a71396k(b), \u201capplies in cases where the State does\nnot actively participate in the litigation\u201d).\n\f4                 GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nlien provision\u201d permitting the State \u201cto recover that portion\nof a settlement that represents payments for medical care.\u201d\nId., at 282, 284\u2013285.\n   Importantly, the Ahlborn Court rejected the State\u2019s claim\nthat it could seek reimbursement more broadly from the re-\nmainder of the settlement funds. It held that \u201cthe anti-lien\nprovision applies\u201d to bar a State\u2019s assertion of a lien beyond\nthe portion of a settlement representing payments for med-\nical care. Id., at 285; accord, Wos v. E. M. A., 568 U. S. 627,\n636 (2013). As relevant to the case before it, the Ahlborn\nCourt concluded that the State could not recover from por-\ntions of a settlement representing compensation \u201cfor dam-\nages distinct from medical costs\u2014like pain and suffering,\nlost wages, and loss of future earnings.\u201d 547 U. S., at 272.\nThe Court noted that it would be \u201cunfair to the recipient\u201d\nand \u201c \u2018absurd\u2019 \u201d for the State to \u201c \u2018share in damages for which\nit has provided no compensation.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 288, and n. 19.\n                               II\n   The Court summarizes Florida\u2019s Medicaid Third-Party\nLiability Act and the facts of petitioner Gianinna Gallardo\u2019s\ncase. See ante, at 3\u20135. The question presented is whether\nthe exception to the anti-lien provision recognized in Ahl-\nborn extends to permit Florida to claim the share of Gal-\nlardo\u2019s settlement allocated for her future medical expenses\nas compensation for the State\u2019s expenditures for her past\nmedical expenses.\n   Before answering that question, a note is in order about\nwhat is not in dispute. Consider a hypothetical example in\nwhich Florida has spent $1,000 on a beneficiary\u2019s medical\ncare, after which the beneficiary secures a $1,500 tort set-\ntlement, $200 of which is allocated for those already-in-\ncurred medical expenses, $500 of which is allocated for fu-\nture medical care, and the remainder of which ($800)\ncompensates for nonmedical expenses. The parties agree,\n\f                   Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)              5\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nas they must, that Florida cannot recover anticipated ex-\npenses for services it has not furnished, but may pursue re-\nimbursement only for expenses it has paid (i.e., Florida can\nrecover no more than $1,000). The parties further agree\nthat Florida can recover these expenses from the portion of\nthe beneficiary\u2019s settlement allocated for these expenses\n(i.e., the $200), and that Florida can challenge the allocation\nof the settlement if it contends that too low a portion was\ndesignated for past medical expenses. The parties also do\nnot dispute that Florida cannot recover from the $800 rep-\nresenting nonmedical expenses. The only dispute is\nwhether Florida also may recover its past medical costs\nfrom the distinct portion of the beneficiary\u2019s settlement rep-\nresenting future medical expenses (i.e., the $500)\u2014ex-\npenses it has not paid and might never pay. Under a proper\nreading of the applicable statutory provisions in context,\nFlorida may not do so.\n   As Ahlborn explains, Florida\u2019s ability to seek reimburse-\nment from Gallardo\u2019s settlement hinges on establishing\nthat an exception to the anti-lien and anti-recovery provi-\nsions applies. Several provisions, enacted over a span of\ndecades, set forth the exception relevant here. The first,\n\u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and (B) (collectively, the third-party lia-\nbility provision), was enacted three years after the Medicaid\nAct and the anti-lien and anti-recovery provisions. The\nthird-party liability provision authorizes a State only to re-\ncover for \u201cmedical assistance\u201d that \u201chas been made availa-\nble on behalf of the individual,\u201d and only \u201cafter medical as-\nsistance has been made available.\u201d            \u00a71396a(a)(25)(B)\n(emphasis added). And it authorizes recovery only \u201cto the\nextent of,\u201d ibid., \u201cthe legal liability of third parties . . . to\npay for care and services available under the plan,\u201d\n\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A). In this context, the provision\u2019s reference\nto care \u201cavailable under the plan\u201d can only be understood to\nrefer to care that is available by virtue of having been paid\nunder the plan, not care that theoretically may or may not\n\f6                 GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nbe made available in the future. Put differently, as a tex-\ntual matter, this provision extends only to a third party\u2019s\nliability to pay for services actually furnished by a state\nplan.\n   Congress subsequently enacted two legal tools for a State\nto use when seeking reimbursement, consistent with the\nthird-party liability provision, for services paid.\n   The first of these tools is the assignment provision,\n\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), enacted in 1977 and made mandatory in\n1984. In that provision, to \u201cassis[t] in the collection of . . .\npayments for medical care,\u201d \u00a71396k(a), Congress required\neach state Medicaid plan to condition eligibility on assign-\nment of \u201cany rights\u201d of the beneficiary \u201cto payment for med-\nical care from any third party,\u201d \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A). Florida\nrests its argument on the understanding that this language\nconfers upon it a right to recover payments designated for\nmedical care regardless of whether those payments com-\npensate for medical care for which Florida actually has\npaid.\n   Several textual signals foreclose Florida\u2019s interpretation\nof the assignment provision. For one, the provision, by its\nterms, does not stand alone. Instead, Congress enacted it\n\u201c[f]or the purpose of assisting in [a State\u2019s] collection of \u201d\npayments for medical care owed to beneficiaries. \u00a71396k(a).\nIt would be anomalous, then, to read the provision to reach\nbeyond the third-party liability provision it \u201cassist[s]\u201d in im-\nplementing. Ibid.; see Guam v. United States, 593 U. S. ___,\n___ (2021) (slip op., at 6) (similarly interpreting a statutory\nprovision in light of an earlier \u201canchor provision\u201d). Support-\ning that understanding, Congress later amended the stat-\nute containing the assignment provision to require benefi-\nciaries \u201cto cooperate with the State in identifying . . . any\nthird party who may be liable to pay for care and services\navailable under the plan.\u201d \u00a71396k(a)(1)(C) (the cooperation\nprovision). The cooperation provision echoes the third-\nparty liability provision\u2019s focus on care \u201cavailable under the\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nplan.\u201d Ibid. It would be bizarre for Congress to mandate a\nmore far-reaching assignment of a beneficiary\u2019s right to\npayment for all medical support, paid or unpaid, but limit\nthe beneficiary\u2019s duty to cooperate only to services paid. Fi-\nnally, another provision of the Act directs each State to pass\nlaws requiring insurers to \u201caccept . . . the assignment to the\nState of any right of an individual or other entity to pay-\nment . . . for an item or service for which payment has been\nmade under the State plan.\u201d \u00a71396a(a)(25)(I)(ii). In this\ninsurer acceptance provision, Congress described the as-\nsignment provision\u2019s mandate as specific to third-party\npayments for services the State plan has funded. Taken\ntogether, these textual indicators establish that the assign-\nment provision reaches only a third party\u2019s liability for ser-\nvices made available by Medicaid, not liability for services\nfor which Medicaid has not paid and may never pay.\n   The second tool Congress enacted to implement the third-\nparty liability provision is the acquisition provision,\n\u00a71396a(a)(25)(H). A 1990 General Accounting Office report\nfound that some health insurers were \u201cthwart[ing]\u201d the as-\nsignment provision by \u201crefusing to pay [States] for any of\nseveral reasons,\u201d including by declining to recognize Medi-\ncaid assignments or by insisting that such assignments con-\nflicted with their insurance contracts. Medicaid: Legisla-\ntion Needed to Improve Collections From Private Insurers\n5 (GAO/HRD\u201391\u201325, Nov.). Congress addressed this in\n1993 by directing each State to enact laws under which the\nState automatically acquires a beneficiary\u2019s rights to third-\nparty payments specifically \u201cfor health care items or ser-\nvices furnished\u201d to the beneficiary, without the need for sep-\narate assignments. \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H). The text of this ac-\nquisition provision, too, clearly restricts a State\u2019s\nacquisition to the portion of a third-party payment pertain-\ning to \u201chealth care items or services\u201d for which \u201cpayment\nhas been made under the State plan\u201d and does not extend\n\f8                 GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nto third-party payments for services the plan has not fur-\nnished. Ibid.; see ante, at 7.\n    This Court\u2019s task is to interpret these provisions \u201c \u2018as a\nsymmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme\u2019 \u201d while\n\u201c \u2018fit[ting] . . . all parts into an harmonious whole.\u2019 \u201d FDA v.\nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133\n(2000). Doing so here leads to only one \u201csymmetrical and\ncoherent\u201d conclusion: that the assignment and acquisition\nprovisions work in tandem to effectuate the third-party lia-\nbility provision. As explained by the United States as ami-\ncus curiae in support of Gallardo, Congress \u201cadded the belt\u201d\n(the acquisition provision) \u201cbecause it feared that the sus-\npenders\u201d (the assignment provision) \u201cwere not doing their\njob.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29. The two\nprovisions take different paths toward the same goal, and\neach reinforces the other. All of the provisions enable a\nState to reimburse itself for expenses it has paid, not for\nexpenses it may or may not incur in the future. None of the\nprovisions authorize a State to seek such reimbursement\nfrom the portions of a beneficiary\u2019s tort settlement repre-\nsenting payments for care for which the State has not paid.\n    This interpretation is also consistent with the structure\nof the Medicaid program as a whole, under which a State\u2019s\nrecovery from a beneficiary\u2019s compensation in tort is per-\nmissible under a narrow exception to the general, asset-pro-\ntective rule established by the anti-lien and anti-recovery\nprovisions. Ahlborn further explained that the third-party\nliability provision and acquisition provision both \u201crein-\nforce[d] the limitation implicit in the assignment provi-\nsion.\u201d 547 U. S., at 280. In particular, the Court described\nthe acquisition provision\u2019s requirement (that a State enact\nlaws under which it acquires a beneficiary\u2019s rights to third-\nparty payments for \u201chealth care items or services furnished\nto an individual\u201d \u201cunder the State plan,\u201d \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H))\nas \u201creiterat[ing]\u201d and \u201cecho[ing]\u201d the assignment provision\u2019s\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

Id., at 276, 281.\nAhlborn\u2019s repeated recognition of the relationships between\nthese three provisions cannot be squared with Florida\u2019s pri-\nmary argument, which would sever the provisions and read\nthe assignment provision to eclipse the limitations of the\nother two.\n   Moreover, Medicaid is an insurance statute, and Ahl-\nborn\u2019s discussion of the unfairness that would ensue from a\nState\u2019s \u201c \u2018shar[ing] in damages for which it has provided no\ncompensation,\u2019 \u201d id., at 288, n. 19, tracks background prin-\nciples of insurance law. Under those principles, recovery by\nan insurer against a third party \u201cis generally limited to the\nsame elements as those for which [the insurer] has made\npayment,\u201d absent contractual terms to the contrary. 16 S.\nPlitt, D. Maldonado, J. Rogers, & J. Plitt, Couch on Insur-\nance \u00a7226:36 (3d ed. 2021); see Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 21\u201322. This, too, supports a cohesive read-\ning of these provisions as allowing States to recover their\npast expenses only from sources that compensate for the\ncare and services state plans actually have furnished.3\n   An additional absurdity would flow from an overbroad\nreading of the assignment provision decoupled from its com-\npanions. Florida maintains that the assignment provision\u2019s\nreference to \u201cany rights . . . to payment for medical care\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Much as an insurer might modify this default rule under contract,\n\nCongress could do so by statute. The parties agree that Congress did so\nas to Medicare, which appears to permit a broader scope of recovery for\nservices (both furnished and to be furnished) from a third party\u2019s liability\nin tort. 42 U. S. C. \u00a72651(a); see Brief for Respondent 41; Reply Brief 8\u2013\n9. But see \u00a72652(c) (providing that \u201c[n]o action taken by the United\nStates . . . shall operate to deny to the injured person the recovery for\nthat portion of his damage not covered\u201d under Medicare). Any difference\nbetween the two programs reflects Medicaid\u2019s focus on the needy, as well\nas the fact that individuals may lose and regain Medicaid eligibility over\ntime based on changes in their circumstances, whereas most Medicare\nenrollees are seniors entitled to coverage for the rest of their lives.\n\f10               GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nfrom any third party,\u201d \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), permits recovery\nfrom settlement funds compensating for all medical ex-\npenses, past or future. If this provision were interpreted in\nisolation to sweep so broadly, however, its text would place\nno temporal limitation on the rights assigned to the State.\nFor example, if Medicaid were to fund an individual\u2019s med-\nical care as a teenager, the State would be entitled to re-\ncover the costs of that care from any unrelated future tort\nsettlement for medical expenses, regardless of whether the\nindividual remained on Medicaid or the state plan fur-\nnished any services related to those future injuries. Such a\nnonsensical \u201clifetime assignment,\u201d Brief for Petitioner 32,\nwould constitute an \u201cunfair\u201d erosion of the anti-lien provi-\nsion, Ahlborn, 547 U. S., at 288, contravening Congress\u2019\ncareful design. In contrast, a harmonious reading of the\nstatute, consistent with Ahlborn, limits the funds from\nwhich a State may recover to those awarded for expenses\npaid and therefore presents no such concern.\n                             III\n  Despite the foregoing, the Court reads the assignment\nprovision standing alone to establish, unlike all the other\nprovisions of the Act at issue, a substantially broader right\nto recover from payments for all medical care, whether paid\nby the State or not. The Court commits several errors on\nthe path to its holding, which departs from the statutory\nscheme as understood in Ahlborn and forces the Court to\nadopt an implausible workaround in order to mitigate the\nabsurd consequence, discussed above, of its acontextual\nreading.\n                              A\n  The Court\u2019s analysis starts off backward. The Court\nstates first that the Act requires a State to condition Medi-\ncaid eligibility on assignment of rights, and only then notes\n\f                   Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             11\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat the anti-lien provision \u201calso\u201d limits States\u2019 recovery ef-\nforts. Ante, at 2. In fact, the anti-lien and anti-recovery\nprovisions establish a general rule, and the subsequently\nenacted third-party liability provision and its companions\ncreate a limited exception. That exception, in turn, should\nnot be construed \u201cto the farthest reach of [its] linguistic pos-\nsibilit[y] if that result would contravene the statutory de-\nsign.\u201d Maracich v. Spears, 570 U. S. 48, 60 (2013). The\nCourt\u2019s misframing, however, causes it to displace the back-\nground principle of the anti-lien and anti-recovery provi-\nsions by relying on language in the assignment provision\nthat is vague at best.\n  The Court places great weight on the assignment provi-\nsion\u2019s use of the word \u201cany\u201d in its reference to \u201crights . . . to\npayment for medical care.\u201d \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A); see ante, at 6.\nThe Court presumes that \u201c \u2018[t]he word \u201cany\u201d has an expan-\nsive meaning.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. But whether the word \u201cany\u201d indicates\nan intent to sweep broadly \u201cnecessarily depends on the stat-\nutory context.\u201d National Assn. of Mfrs. v. Department of\nDefense, 583 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 11). Here, as\nexplained, statutory context establishes that the word \u201cdoes\nnot bear the heavy weight the [Court] puts upon it.\u201d Ibid.\nTo the extent the Court suggests the word \u201cany\u201d supersedes\nall other contrary contextual indications, it ignores prece-\ndent. See, e.g., United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S.\n350, 356\u2013358 (1994) (relying on context to interpret \u201c \u2018any\nlaw-enforcement officer or law-enforcement agency\u2019 \u201d as\nlimited to those making arrests under federal law).\n  The Court also repeatedly relies on the fact that the ac-\nquisition provision and third-party liability provision use\nspecific language to limit the pool from which a State may\nrecover to funds that compensate for expenses Medicaid has\npaid, whereas the assignment provision uses different lan-\nguage. See ante, at 7, 9, 11. The Court invokes the pre-\nsumption that \u201c \u2018[w]here Congress includes particular lan-\nguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another\n\f12               GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsection of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Con-\ngress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate in-\nclusion or exclusion.\u2019 \u201d Russello v. United States, 464 U. S.\n16, 23 (1983). This is unpersuasive. Putting aside the\nmany contextual clues that support Gallardo\u2019s reading of\nthe assignment provision, see supra, at 6\u20137, the presump-\ntion the Court cites is \u201c \u2018strongest\u2019 in those instances in\nwhich the relevant statutory provisions were \u2018considered\nsimultaneously when the language raising the implication\nwas inserted.\u2019 \u201d G\u00f3mez-P\u00e9rez v. Potter, 553 U. S. 474, 486\n(2008). It has less force where, as here, different Con-\ngresses enacted the provisions at issue over the course of\nmultiple decades. The presumption is especially unhelpful\nin this case because it cuts both ways: Since 1965, the anti-\nlien provision has specified that a State may not impose a\nlien against a beneficiary\u2019s property \u201con account of medical\nassistance paid or to be paid on his behalf.\u201d \u00a71396p(a)(1)\n(emphasis added). Accepting the Court\u2019s logic, Congress\nshould have required an assignment that unambiguously\nreached payments for both furnished and unfurnished care\nusing this existing \u201cpaid or to be paid\u201d language, but it\nfailed to do so in the assignment provision. See ante, at 11.\n   Meanwhile, the Court fails to give due regard to the clear\ntextual limitations imposed by the Act as a whole. For in-\nstance, as to the assignment provision\u2019s mirror image in the\ninsurer acceptance provision, see supra, at 7, the Court rea-\nsons that the latter\u2019s \u201cnarrower focus on health insurers,\nwho typically pay only once medical services are rendered,\nexplains its application to a narrower category of third-\nparty payments,\u201d ante, at 10, n. 3. This is beside the point.\nIn the assignment provision, Congress required beneficiar-\nies to assign certain rights to the State; in the insurer ac-\nceptance provision, it required insurers to accept that as-\nsignment. It makes no sense that Congress would require\ninsurers to accept only a sliver of the mandatory assign-\nment, regardless of how insurers typically pay.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Timbers of Inwood\nForest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988). Yet ra-\nther than reading the assignment provision in a manner\n\u201ccompatible with the rest of the law,\u201d ibid., the Court dis-\nconnects it from much of the Act. The Court does not hold\nthat the third-party liability provision extends as far as its\nreading of the assignment provision. See ante, at 10\u201311;\nsee also supra, at 5\u20136. The Court also agrees that the ac-\nquisition provision is \u201cmore limited,\u201d meaning that the\nscope of that provision, too, \u201cdiffer[s]\u201d from that of the as-\nsignment provision. Ante, at 9. To justify these anomalies,\nthe Court asserts that Congress, in enacting the acquisition\nprovision, saw fit to \u201cprovid[e] a more targeted statutory\nright for when the assignment might fail.\u201d Ibid. The Court\noffers little explanation, however, for why Congress might\nhave narrowed such a necessary backstop in this way. The\nstatutory hodgepodge the Court perceives contrasts sharply\nwith the reasonable scheme Congress actually crafted.\n                               B\n  The Court\u2019s reasoning also contradicts precedent. The\nCourt distinguishes Ahlborn because that case did not\nsquarely hold that the relevant provisions \u201cmust\u201d be inter-\npreted in \u201clockstep,\u201d and it reduces Ahlborn\u2019s concern about\nfairness to a disfavored \u201cpolicy argumen[t]\u201d that must yield\nto text. Ante, at 9, 11. But Ahlborn\u2019s analysis reflected the\nCourt\u2019s view of the text and context of the Act as a cohesive\nwhole. It is not only \u201cour sense of fairness,\u201d ante, at 11, but\nCongress\u2019 sense of fairness, as codified in the Act\u2019s anti-lien\nand anti-recovery provisions and recognized in Ahlborn,\nthat demonstrates the Court\u2019s error.\n  The Court itself appears to recognize that its textual\nanalysis leads to unfair and absurd results, leading it to\nsuggest an unpersuasive workaround. The Court responds\nto the lifetime-assignment quandary, see supra, at 9\u201310, by\n\f14                   GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nreasoning that the assignment provision\u2019s use of the phrase\n\u201c \u2018any rights . . . of the individual\u2019 \u201d is \u201cmost naturally read\u201d\nto impose a temporal limitation to rights possessed while on\nMedicaid, ante, at 11\u201312. Neither party even suggests this\nreading of the statute.4 That is because it is anything but\nnatural, especially under the interpretive approach the\nCourt uses today. An \u201cindividual\u201d continues to be an \u201cindi-\nvidual\u201d for the duration of his or her life, whether on or off\nMedicaid. Were there any ambiguity, the word \u201c \u2018any,\u2019 \u201d we\nare told, \u201c \u2018has an expansive meaning\u2019 \u201d that would counsel\nagainst the Court\u2019s implicit limitation. Ante, at 6. Perhaps\nsensing that its claim to natural meaning lacks force, the\nCourt, at last, acknowledges \u201cbackground legal principles\u201d\nthat militate against allowing a lifetime assignment. Ante,\nat 12. While background principles indisputably are rele-\nvant, the Court errs by discarding the more relevant back-\nground rule of insurance law that Congress embraced in the\nAct, see supra, at 9, which could have avoided the Court\u2019s\ndilemma altogether.5\n    Over the long term, the Court\u2019s alteration of the balance\nCongress struck between preserving Medicaid\u2019s status as\npayer of last resort and protecting Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019\nproperty might frustrate both aims. As a State\u2019s right of\nrecovery from any damages payout expands, a Medicaid\nbeneficiary\u2019s share shrinks, reducing the beneficiary\u2019s in-\ncentive to pursue a tort action in the first place. See Brief\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In its briefing, Florida responded to the lifetime-assignment concern\n\nby stating only that its own law did not go so far. Brief for Respondent\n45. Confronted anew with the concern at argument, Florida proposed an\nimplicit \u201cgermaneness requirement,\u201d see Tr. of Oral Arg. 68\u201370, which\nthe Court does not embrace, see ante, at 12, n. 5.\n  5 The Court does not dispute the background principle that an insurer\u2019s\n\nthird-party recovery is limited to the elements for which the insurer has\nmade payment. See supra, at 9. The Court responds, however, that Con-\ngress clearly displaced this principle in the assignment provision. See\nante, at 8, n. 2. That, of course, is the entire question. For the reasons\nexplained, the Court\u2019s reading of the assignment provision is erroneous.\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

The\nCourt\u2019s reading also undercuts Congress\u2019 choice to allow\nMedicaid beneficiaries to place their excess recovery funds\nin Special Needs Trusts, protecting their ability to pay for\nimportant expenses Medicaid will not cover.

Florida\u2019s Medicaid agency paid $862,688.77 to\n  cover Gallardo\u2019s initial medical expenses, and the agency continues to\n  pay her medical expenses. Gallardo, through her parents, sued the\n  truck\u2019s owner and driver, as well as the Lee County School Board. She\n  sought compensation for past medical expenses, future medical ex-\n  penses, lost earnings, and other damages. That litigation resulted in\n  a settlement for $800,000, with $35,367.52 expressly designated as\n  compensation for past medical expenses. The settlement did not spe-\n  cifically allocate any amount for future medical expenses.\n     The Medicaid Act requires participating States to pay for certain\n  needy individuals\u2019 medical costs and then to make reasonable efforts\n  to recoup those costs from liable third parties.            42 U.

Nothing in\n \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) limits a beneficiary\u2019s assignment to payments for past\n \u201cmedical care\u201d already paid for by Medicaid. To the contrary, the grant\n of \u201cany rights . . . to payment for medical care\u201d most naturally covers\n not only rights to payment for past medical expenses, but also rights\n to payment for future medical expenses. \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A); see United\n States v.

For exam-\n ple, when the Medicaid Act separately requires state plans to comply\n with \u00a71396k, it describes that provision as imposing a \u201cmandatory as-\n signment of rights of payment for medical support and other medical\n care owed to recipients.\u201d \u00a71396a(a)(45) (emphasis added).

Thus, if \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\u2019s broad language\nalone were not dispositive, its contrast with the limiting language in\n\u00a71396a(a)(25)(H) would be. Pp. 5\u20137.\n   (b) Gallardo\u2019s arguments that \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) has a different mean-\ning are unconvincing. Gallardo construes the prefatory clause to\n\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\u2014 which provides that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the assignment\nprovision is to \u201cassis[t] in the collection of medical support payments\nand other payments for medical care owed to recipients of medical as-\nsistance under the State plan\u201d\u2014to limit the assignment provision to\npayments that are already \u201cowed\u201d for \u201cpast medical care provided un-\nder the [state] plan.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 30. But the prefatory clause\ndefines to whom the third-party payments are \u201cowed\u201d\u2014\u201crecipients of\nmedical assistance under the State plan.\u201d It does not specify the pur-\npose for which those payments must be made, referring to \u201cmedical\nsupport\u201d and \u201cmedical care\u201d payments, consistent with the adjacent\nlanguage in \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A).\n   Gallardo also proposes that the Court read the assignment provision\nto incorporate the more limited language in \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H). But the\nCourt must give effect to, not nullify, Congress\u2019 choice to include lim-\niting language in some provisions but not others, see Russello v.

Ahlborn, which Gallardo contends eliminated\nany daylight between \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H) and \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), was clear\nthat these two provisions \u201cech[o]\u201d or \u201creinforc[e]\u201d each other insofar as\nthey both involve \u201crecovery of payments for medical care,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145661\"><a href=\"/opinion/145661/arkansas-dept-of-health-and-human-servs-v-ahlborn/\">547 U.

Ahl-\nborn did not suggest that these provisions must be interpreted in lock-\nstep. Gallardo\u2019s idea that one of these two complementary provisions\nmust \u201cprevail\u201d over the other is therefore mistaken. The complemen-\ntary provisions concern different requirements; they do not conflict\njust because one is broader than the other.\n   Gallardo and the United States also argue that \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\nshould be interpreted consistently with \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and (B),\nwhich require a State to seek reimbursement \u201cto the extent of \u201d a third\nparty\u2019s liability \u201cfor care and services available under the plan.\u201d But\nthe relevant language\u2014\u201cpay[ment] for care and services available un-\nder the plan\u201d\u2014could just as readily refer to payment for medical care\n\u201cavailable\u201d in the future. Regardless, Congress did not use this lan-\nguage to define the scope of an assignment under \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), im-\nplying again that the provisions should not be interpreted the same\nway. This implication is strengthened by the fact that \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\nwas enacted after \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and (B), and Congress did not use\nthe existing language in \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and (B) to define the scope\n\f4                      GALLARDO v.

Gal-\nlardo suffered catastrophic injuries and remains in a per-\nsistent vegetative state. Florida\u2019s Medicaid agency paid\n$862,688.77 to cover her initial medical expenses, after\nWellCare of Florida, a private insurer, paid $21,499.30. As\na condition of receiving Medicaid assistance, Gallardo had\nassigned Florida her right to recover from third parties. Be-\ncause Gallardo is permanently disabled, Medicaid contin-\nues to pay her medical expenses.\n  Gallardo, through her parents, sued the truck\u2019s owner\nand driver, as well as the Lee County School Board, seeking\ncompensation for past medical expenses, future medical ex-\npenses, lost earnings, and other damages. Although Gal-\nlardo sought over $20 million in damages, the litigation ul-\ntimately settled for $800,000\u2014a 4% recovery.             The\nsettlement expressly designated $35,367.52 of that amount\nas compensation for past medical expenses\u20144% of the\n$884,188.07 paid by Medicaid and WellCare. The settle-\nment also recognized that \u201csome portion of th[e] settlement\nmay represent compensation for future medical expenses,\u201d\nApp. 29, but did not specifically allocate any amount for fu-\nture medical expenses.\n  Under Florida\u2019s statutory formula, the State was pre-\nsumptively entitled to $300,000 of Gallardo\u2019s settlement\n(37.5% of $800,000). Gallardo, citing the settlement\u2019s ex-\nplicit allocation of only $35,367.52 as compensation for past\nmedical expenses, asked Florida what amount it would ac-\ncept to satisfy its Medicaid lien. When Florida did not re-\nspond, Gallardo put $300,000 in escrow and challenged the\npresumptive allocation in an administrative proceeding.\nThere, Florida defended the presumptive allocation be-\ncause, in its view, it could seek reimbursement from settle-\nment payments for past and future medical expenses, and\nso was not limited to recovering the portion Gallardo had\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U.

Thus, Gallardo con-\ncludes, the anti-lien provision preempts any state law that\n\f6                 GALLARDO v.

Under \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), Florida may seek\nreimbursement from settlement amounts representing\n\u201cpayment for medical care,\u201d past or future. Thus, because\nFlorida\u2019s assignment statute \u201cis expressly authorized by the\nterms of . . .

This\nprovision requires the State to acquire from each Medicaid\nbeneficiary an assignment of \u201cany rights . . . of the individ-\nual . . . to support . . . for the purpose of medical care . . .\nand to payment for medical care from any third party.\u201d\n\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A).

To the contrary, the\ngrant of \u201cany rights . . . to payment for medical care\u201d most\nnaturally covers not only rights to payment for past medical\nexpenses, but also rights to payment for future medical ex-\npenses.

First, when \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) limits the kind\nof \u201csupport\u201d (e.g., child support) covered by a beneficiary\u2019s\nassignment, the statute does not single out support allo-\ncated for past expenses that a State has already paid. In-\nstead, it requires only that support payments be \u201cspecified\nas support for the purpose of medical care\u201d generally.\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U.

Second, when the Med-\nicaid Act separately requires state plans to comply with\n\u00a71396k, it describes that provision as imposing a \u201cmanda-\ntory assignment of rights of payment for medical support\nand other medical care owed to recipients.\u201d \u00a71396a(a)(45)\n(emphasis added).          In short, \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) and\n\u00a71396a(a)(45) distinguish only between medical and non-\nmedical care, not between past (paid) medical care pay-\nments and future (unpaid) medical care payments. If Con-\ngress had intended to draw such a distinction, \u201cit easily\ncould have drafted language to that effect.\u201d Mississippi\nex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">571 U. S. 161</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 169\n(2014).\n   In fact, Congress did include such limiting language else-\nwhere in the Medicaid Act. Section 1396a(a)(25)(H), which\nrequires States to enact laws granting themselves auto-\nmatic rights to certain third-party payments, contains pre-\ncisely the limitation that Gallardo would read into the as-\nsignment provision. That provision applies only when\n\u201cpayment has been made under the State plan for medical\nassistance for health care items or services furnished to an\nindividual,\u201d and covers only third-party payments \u201cfor such\nhealth care items or services.\u201d \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H) (emphasis\nadded). Thus, if \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A)\u2019s broad language alone\nwere not dispositive, its contrast with the limiting language\nin \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H) would be. \u201cHad Congress intended to\nrestrict\u201d \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) to past expenses Medicaid has\npaid, it \u201cwould have done so expressly as it did in\u201d\n\u00a71396a(a)(25)(H).

Regardless, even if this\nlanguage means what Gallardo says it does, Congress did\nnot use this language to define the scope of an assignment\nunder \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), implying again that the provisions\nshould not be interpreted the same way. See supra, at 7.\nThis implication is strengthened by the fact that\n\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A) was enacted after \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and\n(B). It would have been easy for Congress to use the exist-\ning language in \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and (B) to define the\nscope of the mandatory assignment. But it did not.4\n   Finally, Gallardo relies on two policy arguments for her\npreferred interpretation. First, citing a footnote from Ahl-\nborn, she contends that it would be \u201c \u2018absurd and fundamen-\ntally unjust\u2019 \u201d for a State to \u201c \u2018share in damages for which it\nhas provided no compensation.\u2019 \u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145661\"><a href=\"/opinion/145661/arkansas-dept-of-health-and-human-servs-v-ahlborn/\">547 U.

See ante, at\n1\u20133. It devotes comparatively little attention to another\ncentral requirement: that a State not assert claims against\nthe property of Medicaid beneficiaries or recipients.\n  Under the Medicaid Act\u2019s anti-lien provision, enacted in\n1965 as part of the original Act, \u201c[n]o lien may be imposed\nagainst the property of any individual prior to his death on\naccount of medical assistance\u201d provided under the state\nMedicaid plan, whether \u201cpaid or to be paid.\u201d \u00a71396p(a)(1);\nsee Ahlborn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145661\"><a href=\"/opinion/145661/arkansas-dept-of-health-and-human-servs-v-ahlborn/\">547 U.

If a Medicaid benefi-\nciary\u2019s financial circumstances change and a beneficiary\ngains the ability to pay for his or her own medical expenses,\nthe beneficiary is not obligated to repay the State for past\nexpenses, no matter the magnitude of the change in circum-\nstances. Rather, the ordinary consequence is that the indi-\nvidual simply becomes ineligible for benefits moving for-\nward.1\n   In Ahlborn, this Court held that the Medicaid provisions\nenabling the State to seek reimbursement from third par-\nties liable for a beneficiary\u2019s medical care (discussed in de-\ntail below) establish a narrow exception to the anti-lien pro-\nvision. The exception applies where the beneficiary directly\nsues a tortfeasor for payment of medical costs.2 As a thresh-\nold matter, the Court held that a beneficiary\u2019s settlement\nproceeds qualified as beneficiary \u201cproperty\u201d protected by\nthe anti-lien provision unless an exception to that provision\napplied. Id., at 285\u2013286.

See Reply Brief 22,\nn. 6. Such a trust exists to pay expenses not covered by Medicaid, which\nmay include, for example, certain home nursing care or a home ramp for\na wheelchair. Upon a beneficiary\u2019s death, all trust assets are transferred\nto the State until the State is fully reimbursed for all medical assistance\nit has furnished.

See ante, at 3\u20135. The question presented is whether\nthe exception to the anti-lien provision recognized in Ahl-\nborn extends to permit Florida to claim the share of Gal-\nlardo\u2019s settlement allocated for her future medical expenses\nas compensation for the State\u2019s expenditures for her past\nmedical expenses.\n   Before answering that question, a note is in order about\nwhat is not in dispute. Consider a hypothetical example in\nwhich Florida has spent $1,000 on a beneficiary\u2019s medical\ncare, after which the beneficiary secures a $1,500 tort set-\ntlement, $200 of which is allocated for those already-in-\ncurred medical expenses, $500 of which is allocated for fu-\nture medical care, and the remainder of which ($800)\ncompensates for nonmedical expenses. The parties agree,\n\f                   Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)              5\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nas they must, that Florida cannot recover anticipated ex-\npenses for services it has not furnished, but may pursue re-\nimbursement only for expenses it has paid (i.e., Florida can\nrecover no more than $1,000). The parties further agree\nthat Florida can recover these expenses from the portion of\nthe beneficiary\u2019s settlement allocated for these expenses\n(i.e., the $200), and that Florida can challenge the allocation\nof the settlement if it contends that too low a portion was\ndesignated for past medical expenses. The parties also do\nnot dispute that Florida cannot recover from the $800 rep-\nresenting nonmedical expenses. The only dispute is\nwhether Florida also may recover its past medical costs\nfrom the distinct portion of the beneficiary\u2019s settlement rep-\nresenting future medical expenses (i.e., the $500)\u2014ex-\npenses it has not paid and might never pay. Under a proper\nreading of the applicable statutory provisions in context,\nFlorida may not do so.\n   As Ahlborn explains, Florida\u2019s ability to seek reimburse-\nment from Gallardo\u2019s settlement hinges on establishing\nthat an exception to the anti-lien and anti-recovery provi-\nsions applies. Several provisions, enacted over a span of\ndecades, set forth the exception relevant here. The first,\n\u00a7\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A) and (B) (collectively, the third-party lia-\nbility provision), was enacted three years after the Medicaid\nAct and the anti-lien and anti-recovery provisions. The\nthird-party liability provision authorizes a State only to re-\ncover for \u201cmedical assistance\u201d that \u201chas been made availa-\nble on behalf of the individual,\u201d and only \u201cafter medical as-\nsistance has been made available.\u201d            \u00a71396a(a)(25)(B)\n(emphasis added). And it authorizes recovery only \u201cto the\nextent of,\u201d ibid., \u201cthe legal liability of third parties . . . to\npay for care and services available under the plan,\u201d\n\u00a71396a(a)(25)(A). In this context, the provision\u2019s reference\nto care \u201cavailable under the plan\u201d can only be understood to\nrefer to care that is available by virtue of having been paid\nunder the plan, not care that theoretically may or may not\n\f6                 GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nbe made available in the future. Put differently, as a tex-\ntual matter, this provision extends only to a third party\u2019s\nliability to pay for services actually furnished by a state\nplan.\n   Congress subsequently enacted two legal tools for a State\nto use when seeking reimbursement, consistent with the\nthird-party liability provision, for services paid.\n   The first of these tools is the assignment provision,\n\u00a71396k(a)(1)(A), enacted in 1977 and made mandatory in\n1984. In that provision, to \u201cassis[t] in the collection of . . .\npayments for medical care,\u201d \u00a71396k(a), Congress required\neach state Medicaid plan to condition eligibility on assign-\nment of \u201cany rights\u201d of the beneficiary \u201cto payment for med-\nical care from any third party,\u201d \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A). Florida\nrests its argument on the understanding that this language\nconfers upon it a right to recover payments designated for\nmedical care regardless of whether those payments com-\npensate for medical care for which Florida actually has\npaid.\n   Several textual signals foreclose Florida\u2019s interpretation\nof the assignment provision. For one, the provision, by its\nterms, does not stand alone. Instead, Congress enacted it\n\u201c[f]or the purpose of assisting in [a State\u2019s] collection of \u201d\npayments for medical care owed to beneficiaries. \u00a71396k(a).\nIt would be anomalous, then, to read the provision to reach\nbeyond the third-party liability provision it \u201cassist[s]\u201d in im-\nplementing. Ibid.; see Guam v. United States, 593 U. S. ___,\n___ (2021) (slip op., at 6) (similarly interpreting a statutory\nprovision in light of an earlier \u201canchor provision\u201d). Support-\ning that understanding, Congress later amended the stat-\nute containing the assignment provision to require benefi-\nciaries \u201cto cooperate with the State in identifying . . . any\nthird party who may be liable to pay for care and services\navailable under the plan.\u201d \u00a71396k(a)(1)(C) (the cooperation\nprovision). The cooperation provision echoes the third-\nparty liability provision\u2019s focus on care \u201cavailable under the\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nplan.\u201d Ibid. It would be bizarre for Congress to mandate a\nmore far-reaching assignment of a beneficiary\u2019s right to\npayment for all medical support, paid or unpaid, but limit\nthe beneficiary\u2019s duty to cooperate only to services paid. Fi-\nnally, another provision of the Act directs each State to pass\nlaws requiring insurers to \u201caccept . . . the assignment to the\nState of any right of an individual or other entity to pay-\nment . . . for an item or service for which payment has been\nmade under the State plan.\u201d \u00a71396a(a)(25)(I)(ii). In this\ninsurer acceptance provision, Congress described the as-\nsignment provision\u2019s mandate as specific to third-party\npayments for services the State plan has funded. Taken\ntogether, these textual indicators establish that the assign-\nment provision reaches only a third party\u2019s liability for ser-\nvices made available by Medicaid, not liability for services\nfor which Medicaid has not paid and may never pay.\n   The second tool Congress enacted to implement the third-\nparty liability provision is the acquisition provision,\n\u00a71396a(a)(25)(H). A 1990 General Accounting Office report\nfound that some health insurers were \u201cthwart[ing]\u201d the as-\nsignment provision by \u201crefusing to pay [States] for any of\nseveral reasons,\u201d including by declining to recognize Medi-\ncaid assignments or by insisting that such assignments con-\nflicted with their insurance contracts. Medicaid: Legisla-\ntion Needed to Improve Collections From Private Insurers\n5 (GAO/HRD\u201391\u201325, Nov.). Congress addressed this in\n1993 by directing each State to enact laws under which the\nState automatically acquires a beneficiary\u2019s rights to third-\nparty payments specifically \u201cfor health care items or ser-\nvices furnished\u201d to the beneficiary, without the need for sep-\narate assignments. \u00a71396a(a)(25)(H). The text of this ac-\nquisition provision, too, clearly restricts a State\u2019s\nacquisition to the portion of a third-party payment pertain-\ning to \u201chealth care items or services\u201d for which \u201cpayment\nhas been made under the State plan\u201d and does not extend\n\f8                 GALLARDO v.

Doing so here leads to only one \u201csymmetrical and\ncoherent\u201d conclusion: that the assignment and acquisition\nprovisions work in tandem to effectuate the third-party lia-\nbility provision. As explained by the United States as ami-\ncus curiae in support of Gallardo, Congress \u201cadded the belt\u201d\n(the acquisition provision) \u201cbecause it feared that the sus-\npenders\u201d (the assignment provision) \u201cwere not doing their\njob.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29. The two\nprovisions take different paths toward the same goal, and\neach reinforces the other. All of the provisions enable a\nState to reimburse itself for expenses it has paid, not for\nexpenses it may or may not incur in the future. None of the\nprovisions authorize a State to seek such reimbursement\nfrom the portions of a beneficiary\u2019s tort settlement repre-\nsenting payments for care for which the State has not paid.\n    This interpretation is also consistent with the structure\nof the Medicaid program as a whole, under which a State\u2019s\nrecovery from a beneficiary\u2019s compensation in tort is per-\nmissible under a narrow exception to the general, asset-pro-\ntective rule established by the anti-lien and anti-recovery\nprovisions.

This, too, supports a cohesive read-\ning of these provisions as allowing States to recover their\npast expenses only from sources that compensate for the\ncare and services state plans actually have furnished.3\n   An additional absurdity would flow from an overbroad\nreading of the assignment provision decoupled from its com-\npanions.

In contrast, a harmonious reading of the\nstatute, consistent with Ahlborn, limits the funds from\nwhich a State may recover to those awarded for expenses\npaid and therefore presents no such concern.\n                             III\n  Despite the foregoing, the Court reads the assignment\nprovision standing alone to establish, unlike all the other\nprovisions of the Act at issue, a substantially broader right\nto recover from payments for all medical care, whether paid\nby the State or not. The Court commits several errors on\nthe path to its holding, which departs from the statutory\nscheme as understood in Ahlborn and forces the Court to\nadopt an implausible workaround in order to mitigate the\nabsurd consequence, discussed above, of its acontextual\nreading.\n                              A\n  The Court\u2019s analysis starts off backward.

The\nCourt\u2019s misframing, however, causes it to displace the back-\nground principle of the anti-lien and anti-recovery provi-\nsions by relying on language in the assignment provision\nthat is vague at best.\n  The Court places great weight on the assignment provi-\nsion\u2019s use of the word \u201cany\u201d in its reference to \u201crights . . . to\npayment for medical care.\u201d \u00a71396k(a)(1)(A); see ante, at 6.\nThe Court presumes that \u201c \u2018[t]he word \u201cany\u201d has an expan-\nsive meaning.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. But whether the word \u201cany\u201d indicates\nan intent to sweep broadly \u201cnecessarily depends on the stat-\nutory context.\u201d National Assn. of Mfrs. v. Department of\nDefense, 583 U.

Here, as\nexplained, statutory context establishes that the word \u201cdoes\nnot bear the heavy weight the [Court] puts upon it.\u201d Ibid.\nTo the extent the Court suggests the word \u201cany\u201d supersedes\nall other contrary contextual indications, it ignores prece-\ndent. See, e.g., United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087948\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087948/united-states-v-alvarez-sanchez/\">511 U.

See ante, at 7, 9, 11. The Court invokes the pre-\nsumption that \u201c \u2018[w]here Congress includes particular lan-\nguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another\n\f12               GALLARDO v.

Putting aside the\nmany contextual clues that support Gallardo\u2019s reading of\nthe assignment provision, see supra, at 6\u20137, the presump-\ntion the Court cites is \u201c \u2018strongest\u2019 in those instances in\nwhich the relevant statutory provisions were \u2018considered\nsimultaneously when the language raising the implication\nwas inserted.\u2019 \u201d G\u00f3mez-P\u00e9rez v.

It has less force where, as here, different Con-\ngresses enacted the provisions at issue over the course of\nmultiple decades. The presumption is especially unhelpful\nin this case because it cuts both ways: Since 1965, the anti-\nlien provision has specified that a State may not impose a\nlien against a beneficiary\u2019s property \u201con account of medical\nassistance paid or to be paid on his behalf.\u201d \u00a71396p(a)(1)\n(emphasis added). Accepting the Court\u2019s logic, Congress\nshould have required an assignment that unambiguously\nreached payments for both furnished and unfurnished care\nusing this existing \u201cpaid or to be paid\u201d language, but it\nfailed to do so in the assignment provision. See ante, at 11.\n   Meanwhile, the Court fails to give due regard to the clear\ntextual limitations imposed by the Act as a whole. For in-\nstance, as to the assignment provision\u2019s mirror image in the\ninsurer acceptance provision, see supra, at 7, the Court rea-\nsons that the latter\u2019s \u201cnarrower focus on health insurers,\nwho typically pay only once medical services are rendered,\nexplains its application to a narrower category of third-\nparty payments,\u201d ante, at 10, n. 3. This is beside the point.\nIn the assignment provision, Congress required beneficiar-\nies to assign certain rights to the State; in the insurer ac-\nceptance provision, it required insurers to accept that as-\nsignment. It makes no sense that Congress would require\ninsurers to accept only a sliver of the mandatory assign-\nment, regardless of how insurers typically pay.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Yet ra-\nther than reading the assignment provision in a manner\n\u201ccompatible with the rest of the law,\u201d ibid., the Court dis-\nconnects it from much of the Act. The Court does not hold\nthat the third-party liability provision extends as far as its\nreading of the assignment provision. See ante, at 10\u201311;\nsee also supra, at 5\u20136. The Court also agrees that the ac-\nquisition provision is \u201cmore limited,\u201d meaning that the\nscope of that provision, too, \u201cdiffer[s]\u201d from that of the as-\nsignment provision. Ante, at 9. To justify these anomalies,\nthe Court asserts that Congress, in enacting the acquisition\nprovision, saw fit to \u201cprovid[e] a more targeted statutory\nright for when the assignment might fail.\u201d Ibid. The Court\noffers little explanation, however, for why Congress might\nhave narrowed such a necessary backstop in this way. The\nstatutory hodgepodge the Court perceives contrasts sharply\nwith the reasonable scheme Congress actually crafted.\n                               B\n  The Court\u2019s reasoning also contradicts precedent. The\nCourt distinguishes Ahlborn because that case did not\nsquarely hold that the relevant provisions \u201cmust\u201d be inter-\npreted in \u201clockstep,\u201d and it reduces Ahlborn\u2019s concern about\nfairness to a disfavored \u201cpolicy argumen[t]\u201d that must yield\nto text. Ante, at 9, 11. But Ahlborn\u2019s analysis reflected the\nCourt\u2019s view of the text and context of the Act as a cohesive\nwhole. It is not only \u201cour sense of fairness,\u201d ante, at 11, but\nCongress\u2019 sense of fairness, as codified in the Act\u2019s anti-lien\nand anti-recovery provisions and recognized in Ahlborn,\nthat demonstrates the Court\u2019s error.\n  The Court itself appears to recognize that its textual\nanalysis leads to unfair and absurd results, leading it to\nsuggest an unpersuasive workaround. The Court responds\nto the lifetime-assignment quandary, see supra, at 9\u201310, by\n\f14                   GALLARDO v. MARSTILLER\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nreasoning that the assignment provision\u2019s use of the phrase\n\u201c \u2018any rights . . . of the individual\u2019 \u201d is \u201cmost naturally read\u201d\nto impose a temporal limitation to rights possessed while on\nMedicaid, ante, at 11\u201312. Neither party even suggests this\nreading of the statute.4 That is because it is anything but\nnatural, especially under the interpretive approach the\nCourt uses today. An \u201cindividual\u201d continues to be an \u201cindi-\nvidual\u201d for the duration of his or her life, whether on or off\nMedicaid. Were there any ambiguity, the word \u201c \u2018any,\u2019 \u201d we\nare told, \u201c \u2018has an expansive meaning\u2019 \u201d that would counsel\nagainst the Court\u2019s implicit limitation. Ante, at 6. Perhaps\nsensing that its claim to natural meaning lacks force, the\nCourt, at last, acknowledges \u201cbackground legal principles\u201d\nthat militate against allowing a lifetime assignment. Ante,\nat 12. While background principles indisputably are rele-\nvant, the Court errs by discarding the more relevant back-\nground rule of insurance law that Congress embraced in the\nAct, see supra, at 9, which could have avoided the Court\u2019s\ndilemma altogether.5\n    Over the long term, the Court\u2019s alteration of the balance\nCongress struck between preserving Medicaid\u2019s status as\npayer of last resort and protecting Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019\nproperty might frustrate both aims. As a State\u2019s right of\nrecovery from any damages payout expands, a Medicaid\nbeneficiary\u2019s share shrinks, reducing the beneficiary\u2019s in-\ncentive to pursue a tort action in the first place. See Brief\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In its briefing, Florida responded to the lifetime-assignment concern\n\nby stating only that its own law did not go so far. Brief for Respondent\n45. Confronted anew with the concern at argument, Florida proposed an\nimplicit \u201cgermaneness requirement,\u201d see Tr. of Oral Arg. 68\u201370, which\nthe Court does not embrace, see ante, at 12, n. 5.\n  5 The Court does not dispute the background principle that an insurer\u2019s\n\nthird-party recovery is limited to the elements for which the insurer has\nmade payment. See supra, at 9. The Court responds, however, that Con-\ngress clearly displaced this principle in the assignment provision. See\nante, at 8, n. 2. That, of course, is the entire question. For the reasons\nexplained, the Court\u2019s reading of the assignment provision is erroneous.\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

By diminishing beneficiaries\u2019 interests in doing so,\nthe Court\u2019s expansion of States\u2019 assignment rights could\nperversely cause States to recover fewer overall expenses,\nall while unsettling expectations in the States that have re-\nlied on a contrary reading of federal law.6\n   In the end, the Court\u2019s atomizing interpretation has little\nto commend it, particularly when contrasted with the con-\nsistent, administrable scheme Congress crafted. The\nCourt\u2019s reading also undercuts Congress\u2019 choice to allow\nMedicaid beneficiaries to place their excess recovery funds\nin Special Needs Trusts, protecting their ability to pay for\nimportant expenses Medicaid will not cover.

In\n  these six districts, bankruptcy courts continue to appoint bankruptcy\n  administrators under a system called the Administrator Program. The\n  Trustee Program and the Administrator Program handle the same\n  core administrative functions, but have different funding sources.\n  Congress requires that the Trustee Program be funded in its entirety\n  by user fees paid to the United States Trustee System Fund (UST\n  Fund), largely paid by debtors who file cases under Chapter 11 of the\n  Bankruptcy Code. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7589a(b)(5). Those debtors pay a fee in\n  each quarter of the year that their case remains pending at a rate set\n  by Congress and determined by the amount of disbursements the\n  debtor\u2019s estate made that quarter. See \u00a71930(a). In contrast, the Ad-\n  ministrator Program is funded by the Judiciary\u2019s general budget.\n  While initially Congress did not require Administrator Program dis-\n  trict debtors to pay user fees at all, Congress permitted the Judicial\n  Conference of the United States to require Chapter 11 debtors in Ad-\n  ministrator Program districts to pay fees equal to those imposed in\n  Trustee Program districts. See \u00a71930(a)(7). Pursuant to a 2001 stand-\n  ing order of the Judicial Conference, from 2001 to 2017 all districts\n  nationwide charged similarly situated debtors uniform fees.\n     In 2017, Congress enacted a temporary increase in the fee rates ap-\n  plicable to large Chapter 11 cases to address a shortfall in the UST\n\f2                       SIEGEL v. FITZGERALD\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n Fund. See 131 Stat. 1229 (2017 Act). The 2017 Act provided that the\n fee raise would become effective in the first quarter of 2018, would last\n only through 2022, and would be applicable to currently pending and\n newly filed cases. The Judicial Conference adopted the 2017 fee in-\n crease for the six Administrator Program districts, effective October 1,\n 2018, and applicable only to newly filed cases.\n    In 2008, Circuit City Stores, Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in\n the Eastern District of Virginia, a Trustee Program district. In 2010,\n the Bankruptcy Court confirmed a joint-liquidation plan, overseen by\n a trustee (petitioner here), to collect, administer, distribute, and liqui-\n date all of Circuit City\u2019s assets. The liquidation plan required peti-\n tioner to pay quarterly fees to the U. S. Trustee while the Chapter 11\n case was pending. Circuit City\u2019s bankruptcy was still pending when\n Congress increased the fees for Chapter 11 debtors in Trustee Program\n districts through the 2017 Act. Across the first three quarters of 2018,\n petitioner paid $632,542 in total fees, significantly more than the\n $56,400 petitioner would have paid absent the fee increase in the 2017\n Act. Petitioner filed for relief against the Acting U. S. Trustee for Re-\n gion 4 (respondent here) contending that the fee increase was nonuni-\n form across Trustee Program districts and Administrator Program dis-\n tricts, in violation of the Constitution\u2019s Bankruptcy Clause. The\n Bankruptcy Court agreed, and directed that for the fees due from Jan-\n uary 1, 2018, onward, the Circuit City trustee pay the rate in effect\n prior to the 2017 Act. The Bankruptcy Court reserved the question\n whether the trustee could recover any \u201coverpayments\u201d made under the\n 2017 Act. The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the fee increase\n did not violate the uniformity requirement of the Bankruptcy Clause\n because the increase applied only to debtors in Trustee Program dis-\n tricts in order to bolster the dwindling UST Fund, which funded the\n Trustee Program alone.\nHeld: Congress\u2019 enactment of a significant fee increase that exempted\n debtors in two States violated the uniformity requirement of the Bank-\n ruptcy Clause. Pp. 7\u201315.\n    (a) The Bankruptcy Clause\u2019s uniformity requirement\u2014which em-\n powers Congress to establish \u201cuniform Laws on the subject of Bank-\n ruptcies throughout the United States,\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 4\u2014\n applies to the 2017 Act. Respondent contends that the 2017 Act was\n not a law \u201con the subject of Bankruptcies\u201d to which the uniformity re-\n quirement applies, but instead a law enacted pursuant to the Neces-\n sary and Proper Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18, meant to help\n administer substantive bankruptcy law. Nothing in the language of\n the Bankruptcy Clause suggests a distinction between substantive and\n administrative laws, however, and this Court has repeatedly empha-\n sized that the Bankruptcy Clause\u2019s language, embracing \u201claws on the\n\f                   Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsubject of Bankruptcies,\u201d is broad. This Court has never distinguished\nbetween substantive and administrative bankruptcy laws or suggested\nthat the uniformity requirement would not apply to both. Further, the\nCourt has never suggested that all administrative bankruptcy laws are\nenacted pursuant to the Necessary and Proper Clause, nor that the\nNecessary and Proper Clause permits Congress to circumvent the lim-\nitations set by the Bankruptcy Clause. To the contrary, Congress can-\nnot evade the \u201caffirmative limitation\u201d of the uniformity requirement\nby enacting legislation pursuant to other grants of authority. See Rail-\nway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn. v. Gibbons, 455 U. S. 457, 468\u2013469. In\nany event, the 2017 fee provision fits comfortably under the scope of\nthe Bankruptcy Clause: The provision amended a statute titled \u201cBank-\nruptcy fees,\u201d \u00a71930, and the only \u201csubject\u201d of the 2017 Act is bank-\nruptcy. Moreover, the 2017 Act does affect the \u201csubstance of debtor-\ncreditor relations\u201d because increasing mandatory fees paid out of the\ndebtor\u2019s estate decreases the funds available for payment to creditors.\nRespondent points to purported historic analogues to argue that the\nuniformity requirement does not apply where Congress sets different\nfee structures with different funding mechanisms for debtors in differ-\nent bankruptcy districts. But the fee increase at issue here is materi-\nally different from the examples cited by respondent. Unlike respond-\nent\u2019s examples, the 2017 Act does not confer discretion on bankruptcy\ndistricts to set regional policies based on regional needs. Rather, Con-\ngress exempted debtors in only 2 States from a fee increase that ap-\nplied to debtors in 48 States, without identifying any material differ-\nence between debtors across those States. Pp. 7\u201310.\n   (b) The 2017 Act violated the uniformity requirement of the Bank-\nruptcy Clause. The Bankruptcy Clause confers broad authority on\nCongress with the limitation that the laws enacted be \u201cuniform.\u201d The\nCourt\u2019s three decisions addressing the uniformity requirement to-\ngether stand for the proposition that the Bankruptcy Clause does not\npermit arbitrary geographically disparate treatment of debtors. In\nMoyses v. Hanover Nat\u2019l Bank, 186 U. S. 181, the Court rejected a chal-\nlenge to the constitutionality of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, which per-\nmitted individual debtor exemptions under different state laws, ex-\nplaining that the \u201cgeneral operation of the law is uniform although it\nmay result in certain particulars differently in different States.\u201d Id.,\nat 190. In the Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102,\nthe Court affirmed the constitutionality of legislation which applied\nonly to rail carriers operating within a defined region of the country,\nnoting the \u201cflexibility inherent\u201d in the Bankruptcy Clause, id., at 158,\npermits Congress to enact geographically limited bankruptcy laws con-\nsistent with the uniformity requirement in response to a geograph-\nically limited problem. In Gibbons, 455 U. S. 457, the Court struck\n\f4                        SIEGEL v. FITZGERALD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    down legislation in which Congress altered the priority of claimants in\n    a single railroad\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings, holding that \u201c[t]o survive\n    scrutiny under the Bankruptcy Clause, a law must at least apply uni-\n    formly to a defined class of debtors.\u201d Id., at 473.\n       Here, all agree that the 2017 Act\u2019s fee increase was not geograph-\n    ically uniform because the fee increase applied differently to Chapter\n    11 debtors in different regions. That geographical disparity meant\n    that petitioner paid over $500,000 more in fees compared to an identi-\n    cal debtor in North Carolina or Alabama. While respondent contends\n    that such disparities were a permissible effort to solve the budgetary\n    shortfall in the UST Fund, an arguably geographical problem, that\n    shortfall stemmed not from an external and geographically isolated\n    need, but from Congress\u2019 creation of a dual bankruptcy system which\n    allowed certain districts to opt into a system more favorable for debt-\n    ors. The Clause does not permit Congress to treat identical debtors\n    differently based on artificial distinctions Congress itself created.\n    Pp. 10\u201314.\n       (c) The Court remands for the Fourth Circuit to consider in the first\n    instance the proper remedy.

FITZGERALD, III, ACTING UNITED\n        STATES TRUSTEE FOR REGION 4\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n                                   [June 6, 2022]\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Bankruptcy Clause empowers Congress to establish\n\u201cuniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout\nthe United States.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 4. The\nClause\u2019s requirement that bankruptcy laws be \u201cuniform\u201d is\nnot a straitjacket: Congress retains flexibility to craft legis-\nlation that responds to different regional circumstances\nthat arise in the bankruptcy system. Nor, however, is this\nuniformity requirement toothless. The question in this case\nis whether Congress\u2019 enactment of a significant fee increase\nthat exempted debtors in two States violated the uniformity\nrequirement. Here, it did.\n                              I\n                             A\n  Bankruptcy cases involve both traditional judicial re-\nsponsibilities and extensive administrative ones. Until\n1978, bankruptcy judges handled both. This meant that, in\naddition to their traditional judicial function of ruling on\ndisputed matters in adversarial proceedings, bankruptcy\n\f2                  SIEGEL v. FITZGERALD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudges dealt with an array of administrative tasks, such as\nappointing private trustees where appropriate; organizing\ncreditors\u2019 committees; supervising the filing of required re-\nports, schedules, and taxes; and monitoring cases for signs\nof abuse and fraud. See H. R. Rep. No. 99\u2013764, p. 17 (1986).\n   Concerned that these dual roles were overloading bank-\nruptcy judges and creating an appearance of bias, particu-\nlarly because judges were responsible for supervising trus-\ntees that they themselves had appointed, Congress in 1978\npiloted the United States Trustee Program (Trustee Pro-\ngram) in 18 of the 94 federal judicial districts. See id.,\nat 17\u201318; Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2549. To\n\u201crende[r] the separation of administrative and judicial func-\ntions complete,\u201d the pilot program transferred the adminis-\ntrative functions previously handled by the bankruptcy\ncourts to newly created U. S. Trustees, housed within the\nDepartment of Justice rather than the Administrative Of-\nfice of the U. S. Courts. H. R. Rep. No. 95\u2013595, p. 115\n(1977).\n   In 1986, Congress sought to make the pilot Trustee Pro-\ngram permanent and to expand it nationwide, but met re-\nsistance from stakeholders in North Carolina and Alabama.\nSee The United States Trustee System: Hearing on S. 1961\nbefore the Subcommittee on Courts of the Senate Commit-\ntee on the Judiciary, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 129 (1986). As a\nresult, Congress opted to expand mandatorily the Trustee\nProgram to all federal judicial districts except for the six\njudicial districts in North Carolina and Alabama. Congress\npermitted only those six districts to continue judicial ap-\npointment of bankruptcy administrators, referring to that\nsystem as the Administrator Program.              \u00a7\u00a7111\u2013115,\n302(d)(3), 100 Stat. 3090\u20133095, 3121\u20133123. The Adminis-\ntrator Program was scheduled to phase out in 1992, but\nCongress extended it by 10 years. \u00a7317(a), 104 Stat. 5115.\nAt the end of those 10 years, however, Congress did not\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nphase out the Administrator Program. Instead, it elimi-\nnated the sunset period and permanently exempted the six\ndistricts from the requirement to transition to the Trustee\nProgram, while providing that each district could individu-\nally elect to do so. \u00a7501, 114 Stat. 2421\u20132422 (2000 Act);\n\u00a7302(d)(3), 100 Stat. 3121\u20133123. Each of the six districts\ncontinues to participate in the Administrator Program.\n   The Trustee Program and the Administrator Program\nhandle the same core administrative functions, but have\ndifferent funding sources. Congress requires that the Trus-\ntee Program be funded in its entirety by user fees paid to\nthe United States Trustee System Fund (UST Fund), the\nbulk of which are paid by debtors who file cases under\nChapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.                28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7589a(b)(5). Those debtors pay a fee in each quarter of the\nyear that their case remains pending at a rate set by Con-\ngress. The fee varies according to the amount of funds paid\nout (\u201cdisbursed\u201d) from the bankruptcy estate to creditors,\nsuppliers, and other parties during that quarter. See\n\u00a71930(a).\n   In contrast, Congress does not require the Administrator\nProgram to fund itself. Instead, the Administrator Pro-\ngram is funded by the Judiciary\u2019s general budget. In re Cir-\ncuit City Stores, Inc., 996 F. 3d 156, 160 (CA4 2021). Ini-\ntially, Congress did not require Administrator Program\ndistrict debtors to pay user fees at all. After the Ninth Cir-\ncuit held that system unconstitutional, see St. Angelo v.\nVictoria Farms, Inc., 38 F. 3d 1525, 1532\u20131533 (1994),\namended, 46 F. 3d 969 (1995), Congress provided that \u201c \u2018the\nJudicial Conference of the United States may require the\ndebtor in a case under chapter 11 [filed in an Administrator\nProgram district] to pay fees equal to those imposed\u2019 \u201d in\nTrustee Program districts, 2000 Act \u00a7105, 114 Stat. 2412\n(enacting 28 U. S. C. \u00a71930(a)(7)). Congress directed that\nany such fees be deposited into a fund that offsets appropri-\n\f4                  SIEGEL v. FITZGERALD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nations to the Judicial Branch. Ibid. The Judicial Confer-\nence adopted a standing order in 2001 directing Adminis-\ntrator Program districts to charge fees \u201cin the amounts\nspecified in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71930, as those amounts may be\namended from time to time.\u201d Report of the Proceedings of\nthe Judicial Conference of the United States 46 (Sept./Oct.\n2001). Under this standing order, for the next 17 years, the\nJudicial Conference matched all Trustee Program fee in-\ncreases with equivalent Administrator Program fee in-\ncreases, meaning that all districts nationwide charged sim-\nilarly situated debtors uniform fees.\n   In 2017, concerned with a shortfall in the UST Fund,\nCongress enacted a temporary, but significant, increase in\nthe fee rates applicable to large Chapter 11 cases. See Pub.\nL. 115\u201372, Div. B, 131 Stat. 1229 (2017 Act). The increase\nwas set to take effect only if the UST Fund balance dropped\nbelow $200 million as of September 30 of the most recent\nfiscal year. If that condition was met, the increase applied\non a quarterly basis to any debtors with a disbursement of\n$1 million or more during that quarter, regardless of\nwhether their case was newly filed or already pending when\nthe increase took effect. For those debtors, the maximum\nfee was increased from $30,000 a quarter to $250,000 a\nquarter. \u00a71004(a), id., at 1232. The statute provided that\nthe fee raise would become effective in the first quarter of\n2018 and would last only through 2022.\n   Despite the Judicial Conference\u2019s standing order, and un-\nlike with previous fee increases, the six districts in the two\nStates participating in the Administrator Program did not\nimmediately adopt the 2017 fee increase. Only in Septem-\nber 2018 did the Judicial Conference order Administrator\nProgram districts to implement the amended fee schedule.\nEven then, however, two key differences remained between\nthe fee increase faced by debtors in Trustee Program dis-\ntricts as opposed to those faced by debtors in Administrator\nProgram districts. First, the fee increase took effect for the\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsix Administrator Program districts as of October 1, 2018,\nwhile the increase took effect for the Trustee Program dis-\ntricts as of the first quarter of 2018. Second, in Adminis-\ntrator Program districts, the fee increase applied only to\nnewly filed cases, while in Trustee Program districts, the\nincrease applied to all pending cases.\n   In 2021, Congress amended the statute governing parity\nof fees between Trustee Program and Administrator Pro-\ngram districts, \u00a71930(a)(7), to replace the word \u201cmay\u201d with\n\u201cshall.\u201d See Pub. L. 116\u2013325, 134 Stat. 5088. As a result,\nthe statute now provides that the Judicial Conference \u201cshall\nrequire\u201d imposition of fees in Administrator Program dis-\ntricts that are equal to those imposed in Trustee Program\ndistricts.   \u00a71930(a)(7). This change \u201cconfirm[ed] the\nlongstanding intention of Congress that quarterly fee re-\nquirements remain consistent across all Federal judicial\ndistricts.\u201d Id., at 5086.\n                               B\n   In 2008, Circuit City Stores, Inc., filed for Chapter 11\nbankruptcy in the Eastern District of Virginia, a Trustee\nProgram district. In 2010, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed\na joint-liquidation plan, overseen by a trustee (petitioner\nhere), to collect, administer, distribute, and liquidate all of\nCircuit City\u2019s assets. The liquidation plan required peti-\ntioner to \u201c \u2018pay quarterly fees to the U. S. Trustee until the\nChapter 11 Cases are closed or converted.\u2019 \u201d In re Circuit\nCity Stores, 606 B. R. 260, 263 (2019). In 2010, when the\nplan was confirmed, the maximum quarterly fee was\n$30,000.\n   Circuit City\u2019s bankruptcy was still pending when Con-\ngress raised the fees for Chapter 11 debtors in Trustee Pro-\ngram districts through the 2017 Act. Across the first three\nquarters after the fee increase took effect, petitioner paid\n$632,542 in total fees. Id., at 267, n. 20. Had Congress not\nincreased fees, petitioner would have paid $56,400 over that\n\f6                   SIEGEL v. FITZGERALD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsame period. Ibid.\n   Petitioner filed for relief against the Acting U. S. Trustee\nfor Region 4 (respondent here, represented by the Solicitor\nGeneral) in the Bankruptcy Court of the Eastern District of\nVirginia. Petitioner objected that the fee increase under the\n2017 Act was nonuniform across Trustee Program districts\nand Administrator Program districts, in violation of the\nConstitution\u2019s Bankruptcy Clause. The Bankruptcy Court\nagreed, and directed that for the fees due from January 1,\n2018, onward, the trustee pay the rate in effect prior to the\n2017 Act. Id., at 270\u2013271. The court reserved the question\nwhether the trustee could recover any \u201coverpayments\u201d\nmade under the 2017 Act. Ibid.\n   A divided panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed. The court\nagreed that the uniformity requirement of the Bankruptcy\nClause applied to the 2017 Act, but it interpreted the\nClause as forbidding \u201conly \u2018arbitrary\u2019 geographic differ-\nences.\u201d 996 F. 3d, at 166. In the court\u2019s view, the fee in-\ncrease permissibly applied only to Trustee Program dis-\ntricts because the UST Fund, which funded that program\nalone, was dwindling. Therefore, the court reasoned, Con-\ngress\u2019 effort to remedy that problem was not arbitrary.\nJudge Quattlebaum dissented in relevant part, interpreting\nthe Bankruptcy Clause to preclude disparate treatment of\nbankruptcy districts unless the treatment was \u201caimed at\naddressing issues that are geographical in nature.\u201d Id., at\n175. In Judge Quattlebaum\u2019s view, the difference between\nTrustee Program districts and Administrator Program dis-\ntricts was arbitrary, as there was nothing \u201cgeographically\ndistinct about Alabama or North Carolina that justified a\ndifferent approach in those states.\u201d Ibid.\n   This Court granted certiorari, 595 U.

The first\nquestion before the Court is whether the 2017 Act is subject\nto the Bankruptcy Clause\u2019s uniformity requirement at all.\n   Respondent contends that the 2017 Act was not a law \u201con\nthe subject of Bankruptcies\u201d to which the uniformity re-\nquirement applies, but, rather, a law meant to help admin-\nister substantive bankruptcy law. Respondent interprets\nthe Bankruptcy Clause as extending only to laws that \u201calter\nthe substance of debtor-creditor relations,\u201d such as laws\nthat set priorities for claims or exempt property from an es-\ntate. Brief for Respondent 25. In respondent\u2019s view, the\nNecessary and Proper Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18,\nsupplies the authority for Congress to pass a law auxiliary\nto a substantive bankruptcy law.\n   Nothing in the language of the Bankruptcy Clause itself,\nhowever, suggests a distinction between substantive and\nadministrative laws. This Court has repeatedly empha-\nsized that the Bankruptcy Clause\u2019s language, embracing\n\u201claws on the subject of Bankruptcies,\u201d is broad.

Bank v. Moyses, 186 U. S. 181, 187 (1902).\n   Nor has this Court ever distinguished between substan-\ntive and administrative bankruptcy laws or suggested that\nthe uniformity requirement would not apply to both. Re-\nspondent argues that each of this Court\u2019s prior cases on the\nuniformity requirement has addressed what he terms \u201csub-\nstantive bankruptcy laws,\u201d Brief for Respondent 24, but\nthese cases do not establish that the uniformity require-\nment only applies to such \u201csubstantive\u201d laws. This Court\nhas stated that \u201cthe powers of the general grant\u201d of the Nec-\nessary and Proper Clause must be added to the Bankruptcy\nClause\u2019s \u201cspecific grant\u201d of power to Congress to legislate on\nthe subject of bankruptcies. Wright, 304 U. S., at 513. The\nCourt has never suggested, however, that all \u201cadministra-\ntive\u201d bankruptcy laws, Brief for Respondent 13, are enacted\npursuant to the Necessary and Proper Clause, nor that the\nNecessary and Proper Clause permits Congress to circum-\nvent the limitations set by the Bankruptcy Clause. To the\ncontrary, the Court has held that Congress cannot evade\nthe \u201caffirmative limitation\u201d of the uniformity requirement\nby enacting legislation pursuant to other grants of author-\nity. Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn. v. Gibbons, 455 U.

See In re\nClinton Nurseries, Inc., 998 F. 3d 56, 64, and n. 6 (CA2\n2021) (collecting cases). The 2017 fee provision amended a\nstatute titled \u201cBankruptcy fees.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71930.

S. ____ (2022)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprovision\u2019s effect is to set fees that must be paid by a bank-\nruptcy trustee from the debtor\u2019s estate in a bankruptcy pro-\nceeding. The only \u201csubject\u201d of the 2017 Act is bankruptcy.\nMoreover, and importantly, the 2017 Act does affect the\n\u201csubstance of debtor-creditor relations\u201d: Increasing manda-\ntory fees paid out of the debtor\u2019s estate decreases the funds\navailable for payment to creditors. As a result, the obliga-\ntions between creditors and debtors are changed.\n   Respondent also argues that historic and modern con-\ngressional practice support the notion that bankruptcy fees\nare wholly exempt from the uniformity requirement. This\nargument glosses over the nature of the practices at issue.\nThe historic examples respondent cites concern uniform\nfederal laws allowing for local variation by delegating dis-\ncretion to districts to establish their own procedures for cer-\ntain bankruptcy matters, including fees, in view of local\nneeds and conditions. See An Act to Establish an Uniform\nSystem of Bankruptcy Throughout the United States, \u00a747,\n2 Stat. 33 (1800) (providing \u201c[t]hat the district judges, in\neach district respectively, shall fix a rate of allowance to be\nmade to the commissioners of bankruptcy\u201d); An Act to Es-\ntablish a Uniform System of Bankruptcy Throughout the\nUnited States, \u00a76, 5 Stat. 446 (1841) (establishing that dis-\ntrict courts may \u201cprescribe a tariff or table of fees and\ncharges\u201d). Similarly, the contemporary laws respondent\ncites are uniform laws allowing for local determination of\ngoverning rules. See, e.g., 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7158(b)(1), (6)\n(providing that district courts may, but need not, partici-\npate in the bankruptcy appellate panel for its circuit if the\ncircuit has created one). As discussed below, see infra, at\n10\u201312, the uniformity requirement does not demand that\nCongress forbid or eliminate such local variation or choice.\n   The fee increase at issue here is materially different from\nthese laws. It does not confer discretion on bankruptcy dis-\ntricts to set regional policies based on regional needs. Ra-\nther, Congress exempted debtors in only 2 States from a fee\n\f10                 SIEGEL v. FITZGERALD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nincrease that applied to debtors in 48 States, without iden-\ntifying any material difference between debtors across\nthose States. The only difference between the States in\nwhich the fee increase applied and the States in which it\nwas not required was the desire of those two States not to\nparticipate in the Trustee Program. The historical record\ntherefore provides no support for respondent\u2019s argument\nthat the uniformity requirement does not apply where Con-\ngress sets different fee structures with different funding\nmechanisms for debtors in different bankruptcy districts.\n                           B\n  Having determined that the 2017 Act falls within the am-\nbit of the Bankruptcy Clause, the Court must now decide\nwhether the Act was a permissible exercise of that Clause.\n                               1\n   Although the Bankruptcy Clause confers broad authority\non Congress, the Clause also imposes a limitation on that\nauthority: the requirement that the laws enacted be \u201cuni-\nform.\u201d The Court has addressed the uniformity require-\nment on three occasions. Taken together, they stand for the\nproposition that the Bankruptcy Clause offers Congress\nflexibility, but does not permit arbitrary geographically dis-\nparate treatment of debtors.\n   The Court first addressed the uniformity requirement in\nrejecting a challenge to the constitutionality of the Bank-\nruptcy Act of 1898, which permitted individual debtor ex-\nemptions, including homestead and wage exemptions under\nstate laws. Moyses, 186 U. S. 181. The Court in Moyses\nheld that the Bankruptcy Clause\u2019s uniformity principle\ndoes not require Congress to eliminate existing state ex-\nemptions in bankruptcy laws. Id., at 188. The Court ex-\nplained that the \u201cgeneral operation of the law is uniform\nalthough it may result in certain particulars differently in\ndifferent States.\u201d Id., at 190.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Next, in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419\nU. S. 102 (1974), the Court affirmed the constitutionality of\nthe Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, which applied\nonly to rail carriers operating within a defined region of the\ncountry, where \u201c[n]o railroad reorganization . . . was pend-\ning outside that defined region.\u201d Id., at 159\u2013160. The Court\ndescribed the \u201cflexibility inherent\u201d in the Bankruptcy\nClause, id., at 158, which \u201cdoes not deny Congress power to\ntake into account differences that exist between different\nparts of the country, and to fashion legislation to resolve\ngeographically isolated problems,\u201d id., at 159. Because the\nRegional Rail Reorganization Act \u201coperate[d] uniformly\nupon all bankrupt railroads then operating in the United\nStates,\u201d it was consistent with the Bankruptcy Act\u2019s uni-\nformity principle. Id., at 160. Put simply, Congress may\nenact geographically limited bankruptcy laws consistent\nwith the uniformity requirement if it is responding to a ge-\nographically limited problem.\n  While the uniformity requirement allows Congress to ac-\ncount for \u201cdifferences that exist between different parts of\nthe country,\u201d id., at 159, it does not give Congress free rein\nto subject similarly situated debtors in different States to\ndifferent fees because it chooses to pay the costs for some,\nbut not others. In Gibbons, 455 U. S. 457, the Court struck\ndown the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee\nAssistance Act (RITA), in which Congress altered the order\nof priority of claimants in a single railroad\u2019s bankruptcy\nproceedings. The Court recognized that the Bankruptcy\nClause \u201ccontains an affirmative limitation or restriction\nupon Congress\u2019 power,\u201d namely, the uniformity require-\nment. Id., at 468. RITA exceeded this limitation, the Court\nexplained, because it singled out one railroad and did not\napply to other similarly situated railroads that were en-\ngaged in bankruptcy proceedings. Id., at 470. The Court\nreasoned that unlike the Regional Rail Reorganization Act,\nRITA was \u201cnot a response either to the particular problems\n\f12                  SIEGEL v. FITZGERALD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof major railroad bankruptcies or to any geographically iso-\nlated problem: it is a response to the problems caused by\nthe bankruptcy of one railroad.\u201d Ibid. For that reason,\nRITA \u201ccannot be said to apply uniformly even to major rail-\nroads in bankruptcy proceedings throughout the United\nStates.\u201d Id., at 471. The Court emphasized that its \u201chold-\ning . . . does not impair Congress\u2019 ability under the Bank-\nruptcy Clause to define classes of debtors and to structure\nrelief accordingly\u201d and summarized that \u201c[t]o survive scru-\ntiny under the Bankruptcy Clause, a law must at least ap-\nply uniformly to a defined class of debtors.\u201d Id., at 473.\n   In sum, our precedent provides that the Bankruptcy\nClause offers Congress flexibility, but does not permit the\narbitrary, disparate treatment of similarly situated debtors\nbased on geography.\n                               2\n   Here, there is no dispute that the 2017 Act\u2019s fee increase\nwas not geographically uniform. The only remaining ques-\ntion is whether Congress permissibly imposed nonuniform\nfees because it was responding to a funding deficit limited\nto the Trustee Program districts. Under the specific cir-\ncumstances present here, the nonuniform fee increase vio-\nlated the uniformity requirement.\n   All agree that the fee increase applied differently to\nChapter 11 debtors in different regions. Debtors in Ala-\nbama and North Carolina, unlike debtors in the remainder\nof the country, paid no fee increases for the first three quar-\nters of 2018. Moreover, the fee increase only applied to\nnewly filed cases, and not pending cases, in those two\nStates. That geographical disparity meant that petitioner\npaid over $500,000 more in fees compared to an identical\ndebtor in North Carolina or Alabama.\n   Recognizing that the 2017 Act caused such disparities,\nrespondent contends that those disparities were a permis-\nsible effort to solve a particular geographical problem: the\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbudgetary shortfall that befell the UST Fund, which sup-\nports the Trustee Program but not the Administrator Pro-\ngram. Respondent argues that this problem justified Con-\ngress\u2019 imposition of fee increases specific to Trustee\nProgram districts in order to replenish the UST Fund\u2019s cof-\nfers. It is true that Congress\u2019 stated goal in raising fees in\nTrustee Program districts was to address this budgetary\nshortfall. That shortfall, however, existed only because\nCongress itself had arbitrarily separated the districts into\ntwo different systems with different cost funding mecha-\nnisms, requiring Trustee Program districts to fund the Pro-\ngram through user fees while enabling Administrator Pro-\ngram districts to draw on taxpayer funds by way of the\nJudiciary\u2019s general budget.\n  The problem Congress sought to address here is thus dif-\nferent from the problem facing the debtors in the Regional\nRail Reorganization Act Cases. There, a \u201cnational rail\ntransportation crisis\u201d prompted Congress to respond with\nthe Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973. 419 U. S., at\n159. That crisis arose when eight major railroads located\nin the Northeast and the Midwest entered reorganization\nproceedings. Id., at 108. Congress responded accordingly\nwith legislation tailored to those regions. Id., at 108\u2013109.\nThe problems prompting Congress\u2019 disparate treatment in\nthis case, however, stem not from an external and geo-\ngraphically isolated need, but from Congress\u2019 own decision\nto create a dual bankruptcy system funded through differ-\nent mechanisms in which only districts in two States could\nopt into the more favorable fee system for debtors.\n  The Bankruptcy Clause affords Congress flexibility to\n\u201cfashion legislation to resolve geographically isolated prob-\nlems,\u201d id., at 159, but as precedent instructs, the Clause\ndoes not permit Congress to treat identical debtors differ-\nently based on an artificial funding distinction that Con-\ngress itself created. The Clause, after all, would clearly pro-\nhibit Congress from arbitrarily dividing States into two\n\f14                     SIEGEL v. FITZGERALD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncategories and charging different fees to States in different\ncategories unrelated to the needs of, or conditions in, those\nStates. The Clause does not allow Congress to accomplish\nin two steps what it forbids in one.2\n  A few observations on the limits of this decision are in\norder. The Court does not today address the constitution-\nality of the dual scheme of the bankruptcy system itself,\nonly Congress\u2019 decision to impose different fee arrange-\nments in those two systems. The Court\u2019s holding today also\nshould not be understood to impair Congress\u2019 authority to\nstructure relief differently for different classes of debtors or\nto respond to geographically isolated problems. The Court\nholds only that the uniformity requirement of the Bank-\nruptcy Clause prohibits Congress from arbitrarily burden-\ning only one set of debtors with a more onerous funding\nmechanism than that which applies to debtors in other\nStates.\n                              C\n   The parties dispute the appropriate remedy. Petitioner\nseeks a full refund of fees that it paid during the nonuni-\nform period. Respondent argues that any remedy should\napply only prospectively, or should result in a fee increase\nfor debtors who paid less in the Administrator Program dis-\ntricts. The parties raise a host of legal and administrative\nconcerns with each of the remedies proposed, including the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Respondent further argues that any uniformity violation should be\n\nattributed to the Judicial Conference and not to Congress, because Con-\ngress expected the Judicial Conference to implement the 2017 Act\u2019s fee\nincrease in Administrator Program districts. As respondent sees it, it is\nthe Judicial Conference\u2019s failure to implement the fee increase that is\nresponsible for the disparate fees, not the 2017 Act itself. Respondent\nprovides ample evidence that Congress likely understood, when it passed\nthe 2017 Act, that the Judicial Conference would impose the same fee\nincrease. That said, prior to the 2021 amendment, the fee statute did\nnot require the Judicial Conference to impose an equivalent increase. It\nis that congressional decision that led to the disparities at issue here.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Argued April 18, 2022\u2014Decided June 6, 2022\nCongress created the United States Trustee Program (Trustee Program)\n  as a mechanism to transfer administrative functions previously han-\n  dled by bankruptcy judges to U. S. Trustees, a component of the De-\n  partment of Justice. Congress permitted the six judicial districts in\n  North Carolina and Alabama to opt out of the Trustee Program. In\n  these six districts, bankruptcy courts continue to appoint bankruptcy\n  administrators under a system called the Administrator Program. The\n  Trustee Program and the Administrator Program handle the same\n  core administrative functions, but have different funding sources.\n  Congress requires that the Trustee Program be funded in its entirety\n  by user fees paid to the United States Trustee System Fund (UST\n  Fund), largely paid by debtors who file cases under Chapter 11 of the\n  Bankruptcy Code. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7589a(b)(5). Those debtors pay a fee in\n  each quarter of the year that their case remains pending at a rate set\n  by Congress and determined by the amount of disbursements the\n  debtor\u2019s estate made that quarter. See \u00a71930(a). In contrast, the Ad-\n  ministrator Program is funded by the Judiciary\u2019s general budget.\n  While initially Congress did not require Administrator Program dis-\n  trict debtors to pay user fees at all, Congress permitted the Judicial\n  Conference of the United States to require Chapter 11 debtors in Ad-\n  ministrator Program districts to pay fees equal to those imposed in\n  Trustee Program districts. See \u00a71930(a)(7). Pursuant to a 2001 stand-\n  ing order of the Judicial Conference, from 2001 to 2017 all districts\n  nationwide charged similarly situated debtors uniform fees.\n     In 2017, Congress enacted a temporary increase in the fee rates ap-\n  plicable to large Chapter 11 cases to address a shortfall in the UST\n\f2                       SIEGEL v.

The 2017 Act provided that the\n fee raise would become effective in the first quarter of 2018, would last\n only through 2022, and would be applicable to currently pending and\n newly filed cases. The Judicial Conference adopted the 2017 fee in-\n crease for the six Administrator Program districts, effective October 1,\n 2018, and applicable only to newly filed cases.\n    In 2008, Circuit City Stores, Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in\n the Eastern District of Virginia, a Trustee Program district. In 2010,\n the Bankruptcy Court confirmed a joint-liquidation plan, overseen by\n a trustee (petitioner here), to collect, administer, distribute, and liqui-\n date all of Circuit City\u2019s assets. The liquidation plan required peti-\n tioner to pay quarterly fees to the U. S. Trustee while the Chapter 11\n case was pending. Circuit City\u2019s bankruptcy was still pending when\n Congress increased the fees for Chapter 11 debtors in Trustee Program\n districts through the 2017 Act. Across the first three quarters of 2018,\n petitioner paid $632,542 in total fees, significantly more than the\n $56,400 petitioner would have paid absent the fee increase in the 2017\n Act. Petitioner filed for relief against the Acting U. S. Trustee for Re-\n gion 4 (respondent here) contending that the fee increase was nonuni-\n form across Trustee Program districts and Administrator Program dis-\n tricts, in violation of the Constitution\u2019s Bankruptcy Clause. The\n Bankruptcy Court agreed, and directed that for the fees due from Jan-\n uary 1, 2018, onward, the Circuit City trustee pay the rate in effect\n prior to the 2017 Act. The Bankruptcy Court reserved the question\n whether the trustee could recover any \u201coverpayments\u201d made under the\n 2017 Act. The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the fee increase\n did not violate the uniformity requirement of the Bankruptcy Clause\n because the increase applied only to debtors in Trustee Program dis-\n tricts in order to bolster the dwindling UST Fund, which funded the\n Trustee Program alone.\nHeld: Congress\u2019 enactment of a significant fee increase that exempted\n debtors in two States violated the uniformity requirement of the Bank-\n ruptcy Clause. Pp. 7\u201315.\n    (a) The Bankruptcy Clause\u2019s uniformity requirement\u2014which em-\n powers Congress to establish \u201cuniform Laws on the subject of Bank-\n ruptcies throughout the United States,\u201d U.

S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18, meant to help\n administer substantive bankruptcy law.

In\nany event, the 2017 fee provision fits comfortably under the scope of\nthe Bankruptcy Clause: The provision amended a statute titled \u201cBank-\nruptcy fees,\u201d \u00a71930, and the only \u201csubject\u201d of the 2017 Act is bank-\nruptcy. Moreover, the 2017 Act does affect the \u201csubstance of debtor-\ncreditor relations\u201d because increasing mandatory fees paid out of the\ndebtor\u2019s estate decreases the funds available for payment to creditors.\nRespondent points to purported historic analogues to argue that the\nuniformity requirement does not apply where Congress sets different\nfee structures with different funding mechanisms for debtors in differ-\nent bankruptcy districts. But the fee increase at issue here is materi-\nally different from the examples cited by respondent. Unlike respond-\nent\u2019s examples, the 2017 Act does not confer discretion on bankruptcy\ndistricts to set regional policies based on regional needs. Rather, Con-\ngress exempted debtors in only 2 States from a fee increase that ap-\nplied to debtors in 48 States, without identifying any material differ-\nence between debtors across those States.

S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 4. The\nClause\u2019s requirement that bankruptcy laws be \u201cuniform\u201d is\nnot a straitjacket: Congress retains flexibility to craft legis-\nlation that responds to different regional circumstances\nthat arise in the bankruptcy system. Nor, however, is this\nuniformity requirement toothless. The question in this case\nis whether Congress\u2019 enactment of a significant fee increase\nthat exempted debtors in two States violated the uniformity\nrequirement. Here, it did.\n                              I\n                             A\n  Bankruptcy cases involve both traditional judicial re-\nsponsibilities and extensive administrative ones. Until\n1978, bankruptcy judges handled both. This meant that, in\naddition to their traditional judicial function of ruling on\ndisputed matters in adversarial proceedings, bankruptcy\n\f2                  SIEGEL v. FITZGERALD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudges dealt with an array of administrative tasks, such as\nappointing private trustees where appropriate; organizing\ncreditors\u2019 committees; supervising the filing of required re-\nports, schedules, and taxes; and monitoring cases for signs\nof abuse and fraud. See H. R. Rep. No. 99\u2013764, p. 17 (1986).\n   Concerned that these dual roles were overloading bank-\nruptcy judges and creating an appearance of bias, particu-\nlarly because judges were responsible for supervising trus-\ntees that they themselves had appointed, Congress in 1978\npiloted the United States Trustee Program (Trustee Pro-\ngram) in 18 of the 94 federal judicial districts. See id.,\nat 17\u201318; Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">92 Stat. 2549</span><pre class=\"inline\">. To\n\u201crende[r] the separation of administrative and judicial func-\ntions complete,\u201d the pilot program transferred the adminis-\ntrative functions previously handled by the bankruptcy\ncourts to newly created U. S. Trustees, housed within the\nDepartment of Justice rather than the Administrative Of-\nfice of the U. S. Courts. H. R. Rep. No. 95\u2013595, p. 115\n(1977).\n   In 1986, Congress sought to make the pilot Trustee Pro-\ngram permanent and to expand it nationwide, but met re-\nsistance from stakeholders in North Carolina and Alabama.\nSee The United States Trustee System: Hearing on S. 1961\nbefore the Subcommittee on Courts of the Senate Commit-\ntee on the Judiciary, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 129 (1986). As a\nresult, Congress opted to expand mandatorily the Trustee\nProgram to all federal judicial districts except for the six\njudicial districts in North Carolina and Alabama. Congress\npermitted only those six districts to continue judicial ap-\npointment of bankruptcy administrators, referring to that\nsystem as the Administrator Program.              \u00a7\u00a7111\u2013115,\n302(d)(3), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">100 Stat. 3090</span><pre class=\"inline\">\u20133095, 3121\u20133123.

Each of the six districts\ncontinues to participate in the Administrator Program.\n   The Trustee Program and the Administrator Program\nhandle the same core administrative functions, but have\ndifferent funding sources. Congress requires that the Trus-\ntee Program be funded in its entirety by user fees paid to\nthe United States Trustee System Fund (UST Fund), the\nbulk of which are paid by debtors who file cases under\nChapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.                28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7589a(b)(5). Those debtors pay a fee in each quarter of the\nyear that their case remains pending at a rate set by Con-\ngress. The fee varies according to the amount of funds paid\nout (\u201cdisbursed\u201d) from the bankruptcy estate to creditors,\nsuppliers, and other parties during that quarter. See\n\u00a71930(a).\n   In contrast, Congress does not require the Administrator\nProgram to fund itself. Instead, the Administrator Pro-\ngram is funded by the Judiciary\u2019s general budget.

Under this standing order, for the next 17 years, the\nJudicial Conference matched all Trustee Program fee in-\ncreases with equivalent Administrator Program fee in-\ncreases, meaning that all districts nationwide charged sim-\nilarly situated debtors uniform fees.\n   In 2017, concerned with a shortfall in the UST Fund,\nCongress enacted a temporary, but significant, increase in\nthe fee rates applicable to large Chapter 11 cases. See Pub.\nL. 115\u201372, Div. B, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">131 Stat. 1229</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2017 Act). The increase\nwas set to take effect only if the UST Fund balance dropped\nbelow $200 million as of September 30 of the most recent\nfiscal year. If that condition was met, the increase applied\non a quarterly basis to any debtors with a disbursement of\n$1 million or more during that quarter, regardless of\nwhether their case was newly filed or already pending when\nthe increase took effect. For those debtors, the maximum\nfee was increased from $30,000 a quarter to $250,000 a\nquarter. \u00a71004(a), id., at 1232. The statute provided that\nthe fee raise would become effective in the first quarter of\n2018 and would last only through 2022.\n   Despite the Judicial Conference\u2019s standing order, and un-\nlike with previous fee increases, the six districts in the two\nStates participating in the Administrator Program did not\nimmediately adopt the 2017 fee increase. Only in Septem-\nber 2018 did the Judicial Conference order Administrator\nProgram districts to implement the amended fee schedule.\nEven then, however, two key differences remained between\nthe fee increase faced by debtors in Trustee Program dis-\ntricts as opposed to those faced by debtors in Administrator\nProgram districts. First, the fee increase took effect for the\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Second, in Adminis-\ntrator Program districts, the fee increase applied only to\nnewly filed cases, while in Trustee Program districts, the\nincrease applied to all pending cases.\n   In 2021, Congress amended the statute governing parity\nof fees between Trustee Program and Administrator Pro-\ngram districts, \u00a71930(a)(7), to replace the word \u201cmay\u201d with\n\u201cshall.\u201d See Pub. L. 116\u2013325, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">134 Stat. 5088</span><pre class=\"inline\">. As a result,\nthe statute now provides that the Judicial Conference \u201cshall\nrequire\u201d imposition of fees in Administrator Program dis-\ntricts that are equal to those imposed in Trustee Program\ndistricts.   \u00a71930(a)(7). This change \u201cconfirm[ed] the\nlongstanding intention of Congress that quarterly fee re-\nquirements remain consistent across all Federal judicial\ndistricts.\u201d Id., at 5086.\n                               B\n   In 2008, Circuit City Stores, Inc., filed for Chapter 11\nbankruptcy in the Eastern District of Virginia, a Trustee\nProgram district. In 2010, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed\na joint-liquidation plan, overseen by a trustee (petitioner\nhere), to collect, administer, distribute, and liquidate all of\nCircuit City\u2019s assets. The liquidation plan required peti-\ntioner to \u201c \u2018pay quarterly fees to the U. S. Trustee until the\nChapter 11 Cases are closed or converted.\u2019 \u201d In re Circuit\nCity Stores, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 B. R. 260</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263 (2019). In 2010, when the\nplan was confirmed, the maximum quarterly fee was\n$30,000.\n   Circuit City\u2019s bankruptcy was still pending when Con-\ngress raised the fees for Chapter 11 debtors in Trustee Pro-\ngram districts through the 2017 Act. Across the first three\nquarters after the fee increase took effect, petitioner paid\n$632,542 in total fees. Id., at 267, n. 20. Had Congress not\nincreased fees, petitioner would have paid $56,400 over that\n\f6                   SIEGEL v. FITZGERALD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsame period. Ibid.\n   Petitioner filed for relief against the Acting U. S. Trustee\nfor Region 4 (respondent here, represented by the Solicitor\nGeneral) in the Bankruptcy Court of the Eastern District of\nVirginia. Petitioner objected that the fee increase under the\n2017 Act was nonuniform across Trustee Program districts\nand Administrator Program districts, in violation of the\nConstitution\u2019s Bankruptcy Clause. The Bankruptcy Court\nagreed, and directed that for the fees due from January 1,\n2018, onward, the trustee pay the rate in effect prior to the\n2017 Act. Id., at 270\u2013271. The court reserved the question\nwhether the trustee could recover any \u201coverpayments\u201d\nmade under the 2017 Act. Ibid.\n   A divided panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed. The court\nagreed that the uniformity requirement of the Bankruptcy\nClause applied to the 2017 Act, but it interpreted the\nClause as forbidding \u201conly \u2018arbitrary\u2019 geographic differ-\nences.\u201d 996 F. 3d, at 166. In the court\u2019s view, the fee in-\ncrease permissibly applied only to Trustee Program dis-\ntricts because the UST Fund, which funded that program\nalone, was dwindling. Therefore, the court reasoned, Con-\ngress\u2019 effort to remedy that problem was not arbitrary.\nJudge Quattlebaum dissented in relevant part, interpreting\nthe Bankruptcy Clause to preclude disparate treatment of\nbankruptcy districts unless the treatment was \u201caimed at\naddressing issues that are geographical in nature.\u201d Id., at\n175. In Judge Quattlebaum\u2019s view, the difference between\nTrustee Program districts and Administrator Program dis-\ntricts was arbitrary, as there was nothing \u201cgeographically\ndistinct about Alabama or North Carolina that justified a\ndifferent approach in those states.\u201d Ibid.\n   This Court granted certiorari, 595 U.

S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 4. The first\nquestion before the Court is whether the 2017 Act is subject\nto the Bankruptcy Clause\u2019s uniformity requirement at all.\n   Respondent contends that the 2017 Act was not a law \u201con\nthe subject of Bankruptcies\u201d to which the uniformity re-\nquirement applies, but, rather, a law meant to help admin-\nister substantive bankruptcy law. Respondent interprets\nthe Bankruptcy Clause as extending only to laws that \u201calter\nthe substance of debtor-creditor relations,\u201d such as laws\nthat set priorities for claims or exempt property from an es-\ntate. Brief for Respondent 25. In respondent\u2019s view, the\nNecessary and Proper Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18,\nsupplies the authority for Congress to pass a law auxiliary\nto a substantive bankruptcy law.\n   Nothing in the language of the Bankruptcy Clause itself,\nhowever, suggests a distinction between substantive and\nadministrative laws. This Court has repeatedly empha-\nsized that the Bankruptcy Clause\u2019s language, embracing\n\u201claws on the subject of Bankruptcies,\u201d is broad. For exam-\nple, the Court has recognized that the \u201csubject of bankrupt-\ncies is incapable of final definition,\u201d and includes \u201cnothing\nless than \u2018the subject of the relations between [a] debtor and\nhis creditors.\u2019 \u201d Wright v.

The only \u201csubject\u201d of the 2017 Act is bankruptcy.\nMoreover, and importantly, the 2017 Act does affect the\n\u201csubstance of debtor-creditor relations\u201d: Increasing manda-\ntory fees paid out of the debtor\u2019s estate decreases the funds\navailable for payment to creditors. As a result, the obliga-\ntions between creditors and debtors are changed.\n   Respondent also argues that historic and modern con-\ngressional practice support the notion that bankruptcy fees\nare wholly exempt from the uniformity requirement. This\nargument glosses over the nature of the practices at issue.\nThe historic examples respondent cites concern uniform\nfederal laws allowing for local variation by delegating dis-\ncretion to districts to establish their own procedures for cer-\ntain bankruptcy matters, including fees, in view of local\nneeds and conditions. See An Act to Establish an Uniform\nSystem of Bankruptcy Throughout the United States, \u00a747,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2 Stat. 33</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1800) (providing \u201c[t]hat the district judges, in\neach district respectively, shall fix a rate of allowance to be\nmade to the commissioners of bankruptcy\u201d); An Act to Es-\ntablish a Uniform System of Bankruptcy Throughout the\nUnited States, \u00a76, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 Stat. 446</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1841) (establishing that dis-\ntrict courts may \u201cprescribe a tariff or table of fees and\ncharges\u201d). Similarly, the contemporary laws respondent\ncites are uniform laws allowing for local determination of\ngoverning rules. See, e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U. S.

As discussed below, see infra, at\n10\u201312, the uniformity requirement does not demand that\nCongress forbid or eliminate such local variation or choice.\n   The fee increase at issue here is materially different from\nthese laws. It does not confer discretion on bankruptcy dis-\ntricts to set regional policies based on regional needs. Ra-\nther, Congress exempted debtors in only 2 States from a fee\n\f10                 SIEGEL v. FITZGERALD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nincrease that applied to debtors in 48 States, without iden-\ntifying any material difference between debtors across\nthose States. The only difference between the States in\nwhich the fee increase applied and the States in which it\nwas not required was the desire of those two States not to\nparticipate in the Trustee Program. The historical record\ntherefore provides no support for respondent\u2019s argument\nthat the uniformity requirement does not apply where Con-\ngress sets different fee structures with different funding\nmechanisms for debtors in different bankruptcy districts.\n                           B\n  Having determined that the 2017 Act falls within the am-\nbit of the Bankruptcy Clause, the Court must now decide\nwhether the Act was a permissible exercise of that Clause.\n                               1\n   Although the Bankruptcy Clause confers broad authority\non Congress, the Clause also imposes a limitation on that\nauthority: the requirement that the laws enacted be \u201cuni-\nform.\u201d The Court has addressed the uniformity require-\nment on three occasions. Taken together, they stand for the\nproposition that the Bankruptcy Clause offers Congress\nflexibility, but does not permit arbitrary geographically dis-\nparate treatment of debtors.\n   The Court first addressed the uniformity requirement in\nrejecting a challenge to the constitutionality of the Bank-\nruptcy Act of 1898, which permitted individual debtor ex-\nemptions, including homestead and wage exemptions under\nstate laws.

The only remaining ques-\ntion is whether Congress permissibly imposed nonuniform\nfees because it was responding to a funding deficit limited\nto the Trustee Program districts. Under the specific cir-\ncumstances present here, the nonuniform fee increase vio-\nlated the uniformity requirement.\n   All agree that the fee increase applied differently to\nChapter 11 debtors in different regions. Debtors in Ala-\nbama and North Carolina, unlike debtors in the remainder\nof the country, paid no fee increases for the first three quar-\nters of 2018. Moreover, the fee increase only applied to\nnewly filed cases, and not pending cases, in those two\nStates. That geographical disparity meant that petitioner\npaid over $500,000 more in fees compared to an identical\ndebtor in North Carolina or Alabama.\n   Recognizing that the 2017 Act caused such disparities,\nrespondent contends that those disparities were a permis-\nsible effort to solve a particular geographical problem: the\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Respondent argues that this problem justified Con-\ngress\u2019 imposition of fee increases specific to Trustee\nProgram districts in order to replenish the UST Fund\u2019s cof-\nfers. It is true that Congress\u2019 stated goal in raising fees in\nTrustee Program districts was to address this budgetary\nshortfall. That shortfall, however, existed only because\nCongress itself had arbitrarily separated the districts into\ntwo different systems with different cost funding mecha-\nnisms, requiring Trustee Program districts to fund the Pro-\ngram through user fees while enabling Administrator Pro-\ngram districts to draw on taxpayer funds by way of the\nJudiciary\u2019s general budget.\n  The problem Congress sought to address here is thus dif-\nferent from the problem facing the debtors in the Regional\nRail Reorganization Act Cases. There, a \u201cnational rail\ntransportation crisis\u201d prompted Congress to respond with\nthe Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109117\"><a href=\"/opinion/109117/regional-rail-reorganization-act-cases/\">419 U.

That crisis arose when eight major railroads located\nin the Northeast and the Midwest entered reorganization\nproceedings. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109117\"><a href=\"/opinion/109117/regional-rail-reorganization-act-cases/\">Id., at 108</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

The Clause does not allow Congress to accomplish\nin two steps what it forbids in one.2\n  A few observations on the limits of this decision are in\norder. The Court does not today address the constitution-\nality of the dual scheme of the bankruptcy system itself,\nonly Congress\u2019 decision to impose different fee arrange-\nments in those two systems. The Court\u2019s holding today also\nshould not be understood to impair Congress\u2019 authority to\nstructure relief differently for different classes of debtors or\nto respond to geographically isolated problems. The Court\nholds only that the uniformity requirement of the Bank-\nruptcy Clause prohibits Congress from arbitrarily burden-\ning only one set of debtors with a more onerous funding\nmechanism than that which applies to debtors in other\nStates.\n                              C\n   The parties dispute the appropriate remedy. Petitioner\nseeks a full refund of fees that it paid during the nonuni-\nform period. Respondent argues that any remedy should\napply only prospectively, or should result in a fee increase\nfor debtors who paid less in the Administrator Program dis-\ntricts. The parties raise a host of legal and administrative\nconcerns with each of the remedies proposed, including the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Respondent further argues that any uniformity violation should be\n\nattributed to the Judicial Conference and not to Congress, because Con-\ngress expected the Judicial Conference to implement the 2017 Act\u2019s fee\nincrease in Administrator Program districts. As respondent sees it, it is\nthe Judicial Conference\u2019s failure to implement the fee increase that is\nresponsible for the disparate fees, not the 2017 Act itself. Respondent\nprovides ample evidence that Congress likely understood, when it passed\nthe 2017 Act, that the Judicial Conference would impose the same fee\nincrease. That said, prior to the 2021 amendment, the fee statute did\nnot require the Judicial Conference to impose an equivalent increase. It\nis that congressional decision that led to the disparities at issue here.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Argued March 28, 2022\u2014Decided June 6, 2022\nRespondent Latrice Saxon, a ramp supervisor for Southwest Airlines,\n  trains and supervises teams of ramp agents who physically load and\n  unload cargo on and off airplanes that travel across the country. Like\n  many ramp supervisors, Saxon also frequently loads and unloads cargo\n  alongside the ramp agents. Saxon came to believe that Southwest was\n  failing to pay proper overtime wages to ramp supervisors, and she\n  brought a putative class action against Southwest under the Fair La-\n  bor Standards Act of 1938. Because Saxon\u2019s employment contract re-\n  quired her to arbitrate wage disputes individually, Southwest sought\n  to enforce its arbitration agreement and moved to dismiss. In re-\n  sponse, Saxon claimed that ramp supervisors were a \u201cclass of workers\n  engaged in foreign or interstate commerce\u201d and therefore exempt from\n  the Federal Arbitration Act\u2019s coverage. 9 U. S. C. \u00a71. The District\n  Court disagreed, holding that only those involved in \u201cactual transpor-\n  tation,\u201d and not those who merely handle goods, fell within \u00a71\u2019s exemp-\n  tion. The Court of Appeals reversed. It held that \u201c[t]he act of loading\n  cargo onto a vehicle to be transported interstate is itself commerce, as\n  that term was understood at the time of the [FAA\u2019s] enactment in\n  1925.\u201d 993 F. 3d 492, 494.\nHeld: Saxon belongs to a \u201cclass of workers engaged in foreign or inter-\n state commerce\u201d to which \u00a71\u2019s exemption applies.

SAXON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n         (1) The parties dispute how to define the relevant \u201cclass of work-\n    ers.\u201d Saxon argues that because the air transportation industry en-\n    gages in interstate commerce, airline employees, as a whole, constitute\n    a \u201cclass of workers\u201d covered by \u00a71. By contrast, Southwest maintains\n    that the relevant class includes only those airline employees actually\n    engaged day-to-day in interstate commerce. This Court rejects Saxon\u2019s\n    industrywide approach. By referring to \u201cworkers\u201d rather than \u201cem-\n    ployees,\u201d the FAA directs attention to \u201cthe performance of work.\u201d New\n    Prime Inc. v. Oliveira, 586 U. S. ___, ___. And the word \u201cengaged\u201d sim-\n    ilarly emphasizes the actual work that class members typically carry\n    out. Saxon is therefore a member of a \u201cclass of workers\u201d based on what\n    she frequently does at Southwest\u2014that is, physically loading and un-\n    loading cargo on and off airplanes\u2014and not on what Southwest does\n    generally. Pp. 3\u20134.\n         (2) The parties also dispute whether the class of airplane cargo\n    loaders is \u201cengaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\u201d It is. To be\n    \u201cengaged\u201d in \u201ccommerce\u201d means to be directly involved in transporting\n    goods across state or international borders. Thus, any class of workers\n    so engaged falls within \u00a71\u2019s exemption. Airplane cargo loaders are\n    such a class.\n       Context confirms this reading. In Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,\n    532 U. S. 105, the Court applied two well-settled canons of statutory\n    interpretation to hold that \u00a71 exempted only \u201ctransportation workers,\u201d\n    rather than all employees. The Court indicated that any such ex-\n    empted worker must at least play a direct and \u201cnecessary role in the\n    free flow of goods\u201d across borders. Id., at 121. Cargo loaders exhibit\n    this central feature of a transportation worker.\n       A final piece of statutory context further confirms that cargo loading\n    is part of cross-border \u201ccommerce.\u201d Section 1 of the FAA defines ex-\n    empted \u201cmaritime transactions\u201d to include \u201cagreements relating to\n    wharfage . . . or any other matters in foreign commerce.\u201d Thus, if an\n    \u201cagreemen[t] relating to wharfage\u201d\u2014i.e., money paid to access a cargo-\n    loading facility\u2014is a \u201cmatte[r] in foreign commerce,\u201d it stands to rea-\n    son that an individual who actually loads cargo on vehicles traveling\n    across borders is himself engaged in such commerce. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Both parties proffer arguments disagreeing with this analysis,\n    but none is convincing. Pp. 7\u201311.\n         (1) Saxon thinks the relevant \u201cclass of workers\u201d should include all\n    airline employees, not just cargo loaders. For support, she argues that\n    \u201crailroad employees\u201d and \u201cseamen\u201d\u2014two classes of workers listed im-\n    mediately before \u00a71\u2019s catchall provision\u2014refer generally to employees\n    in those industries. Saxon\u2019s premise is flawed. \u201cSeamen\u201d is not an\n    industrywide category but instead a subset of workers engaged in the\n    maritime shipping industry. For example, \u201cseamen\u201d did not include\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  all those employed by companies engaged in maritime shipping when\n  the FAA was enacted. Pp. 8\u20139.\n       (2) Southwest\u2019s three counterarguments all fail. First, Southwest\n  narrowly construes \u00a71\u2019s catchall category\u2014\u201cany other class of workers\n  engaged in foreign or interstate commerce\u201d\u2014to include only workers\n  who physically transport goods or people across foreign or interna-\n  tional boundaries. Southwest relies on the definition of \u201cseamen\u201d as\n  only those \u201cemployed on board a vessel,\u201d McDermott Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Wilan-\n  der, 498 U. S. 337, 346, and argues that the catchall category should\n  be read along the same lines to exclude airline workers, like Saxon,\n  who do not ride aboard an airplane in interstate or foreign transit. But\n  Southwest\u2019s acknowledgment that the statute\u2019s reference to \u201crailroad\n  employees\u201d is somewhat ambiguous in effect concedes that the three\n  statutory categories in \u00a71\u2014\u201cseamen, railroad employees, or any other\n  class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce\u201d\u2014do not\n  share the attribute that Southwest would like read into the catchall\n  provision. Well-settled canons of statutory interpretation neither de-\n  mand nor permit limiting a broadly worded catchall phrase based on\n  an attribute that inheres in only one of the list\u2019s preceding specific\n  terms. Second, Southwest argues that cargo loading is similar to other\n  activities that this Court has found to lack a necessary nexus to inter-\n  state commerce in other contexts. But the cases Southwest invokes all\n  addressed activities far more removed from interstate commerce than\n  physically loading cargo directly on and off an airplane headed out of\n  State. See, e.g., Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U. S. 186. Fi-\n  nally, Southwest argues that the FAA\u2019s \u201cproarbitration purposes\u201d\n  counsel in favor of an interpretation that errs on the side of fewer \u00a71\n  exemptions. Here, however, plain text suffices to show that airplane\n  cargo loaders, and thus ramp supervisors who frequently load and un-\n  load cargo, are exempt from the FAA\u2019s scope under \u00a71.

Her work frequently requires her to load and un-\nload baggage, airmail, and commercial cargo on and off air-\nplanes that travel across the country. The question\npresented is whether, under \u00a71 of the Federal Arbitration\nAct, she belongs to a \u201cclass of workers engaged in foreign or\ninterstate commerce\u201d that is exempted from the Act\u2019s cov-\nerage. We hold that she does.\n                             I\n  Southwest Airlines moves a lot of cargo.

It also employs \u201cramp supervisors,\u201d who train and\nsupervise teams of ramp agents. Frequently, ramp super-\nvisors step in to load and unload cargo alongside ramp\nagents. See 993 F. 3d 492, 494 (CA7 2021).\n  Saxon is a ramp supervisor for Southwest at Chicago\nMidway International Airport. As part of her employment\ncontract, she agreed to arbitrate wage disputes individu-\nally. Nevertheless, when Saxon came to believe that South-\nwest was failing to pay proper overtime wages to her and\nother ramp supervisors, she brought a putative class action\nagainst Southwest under the Fair Labor Standards Act of\n1938, 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7201 et seq.\n  Southwest sought to enforce its arbitration agreement\nwith Saxon under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9\nU. S. C. \u00a71 et seq., and moved to dismiss the lawsuit. In re-\nsponse, Saxon invoked \u00a71 of the FAA, which exempts from\nthe statute\u2019s ambit \u201ccontracts of employment of seamen,\nrailroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged\nin foreign or interstate commerce.\u201d Saxon argued that\nramp supervisors, like seamen and railroad employees,\nwere an exempt \u201cclass of workers engaged in foreign or in-\nterstate commerce.\u201d Ibid.\n  The District Court disagreed, holding that only those in-\nvolved in \u201cactual transportation,\u201d and not the \u201cmer[e] han-\ndling [of] goods,\u201d fell within the exemption. 2019 WL\n4958247, *7 (ND Ill., Oct. 8, 2019). The Court of Appeals\nreversed. It held that \u201c[t]he act of loading cargo onto a ve-\nhicle to be transported interstate is itself commerce, as that\nterm was understood at the time of the [FAA\u2019s] enactment\nin 1925.\u201d 993 F. 3d, at 494. Citing Saxon\u2019s \u201cuncontroverted\ndeclaration\u201d that ramp supervisors at Midway \u201cfrequently\u201d\nload and unload cargo, the Court of Appeals reserved the\nquestion \u201cwhether supervision of cargo loading alone\u201d\nwould also fall within the FAA\u2019s \u00a71 exemption.

Brief for Respondent 17. Southwest, by contrast, main-\ntains that \u00a71 \u201cexempts classes of workers based on their\nconduct, not their employer\u2019s,\u201d and the relevant class there-\nfore includes only those airline employees who are actually\nengaged in interstate commerce in their day-to-day work.\nReply Brief 4. The Court of Appeals rejected Saxon\u2019s indus-\ntrywide approach, see 993 F. 3d, at 497, and so do we.\n\f4              SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. v. SAXON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   As we have observed before, the FAA speaks of \u201c \u2018work-\ners,\u2019 \u201d not \u201c \u2018employees\u2019 or \u2018servants.\u2019 \u201d New Prime, 586 U.

The word \u201cworkers\u201d directs\nthe interpreter\u2019s attention to \u201cthe performance of work.\u201d\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (emphasis altered); see also Web-\nster\u2019s New International Dictionary 2350 (1922) (Webster\u2019s)\n(worker: \u201cOne that works\u201d); Funk & Wagnall\u2019s New Stand-\nard Dictionary 2731 (1913) (worker: \u201cOne who or that which\nperforms work\u201d). Further, the word \u201cengaged\u201d\u2014meaning\n\u201c[o]ccupied,\u201d \u201cemployed,\u201d or \u201c[i]nvolved,\u201d Webster\u2019s 725; see\nalso, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 661 (3d ed. 1933) (defining\n\u201cengage\u201d)\u2014similarly emphasizes the actual work that the\nmembers of the class, as a whole, typically carry out. Saxon\nis therefore a member of a \u201cclass of workers\u201d based on what\nshe does at Southwest, not what Southwest does generally.\n   On that point, Southwest has not meaningfully contested\nthat ramp supervisors like Saxon frequently load and un-\nload cargo. See 993 F. 3d, at 494, 497 (noting Saxon\u2019s \u201cun-\ncontroverted declaration assert[ing] that she and the other\nramp supervisors . . . frequently fill in as ramp agents\u201d for\nup to three shifts per week). Thus, as relevant here, we\naccept that Saxon belongs to a class of workers who physi-\ncally load and unload cargo on and off airplanes on a fre-\nquent basis.1\n                              B\n  Second, the parties dispute whether that class of airplane\ncargo loaders is \u201cengaged in foreign or interstate commerce\u201d\nunder \u00a71. We hold that it is.\n   As always, we begin with the text. Again, to be \u201cen-\ngaged\u201d in something means to be \u201coccupied,\u201d \u201cemployed,\u201d or\n\u201cinvolved\u201d in it. \u201cCommerce,\u201d meanwhile, includes, among\nother things, \u201cthe transportation of . . . goods, both by land\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Like the Seventh Circuit, we \u201cneed not consider . . . whether supervi-\n\nsion of cargo loading alone would suffice\u201d to exempt a class of workers\nunder \u00a71. 993 F. 3d 492, 497 (2021).\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

Thus, any class of workers di-\nrectly involved in transporting goods across state or inter-\nnational borders falls within \u00a71\u2019s exemption.\n   Airplane cargo loaders are such a class. We have said\nthat it is \u201ctoo plain to require discussion that the loading or\nunloading of an interstate shipment by the employees of a\ncarrier is so closely related to interstate transportation as\nto be practically a part of it.\u201d Baltimore & Ohio Southwest-\nern R. Co. v. Burtch, 263 U. S. 540, 544 (1924). We think it\nequally plain that airline employees who physically load\nand unload cargo on and off planes traveling in interstate\ncommerce are, as a practical matter, part of the interstate\ntransportation of goods. They form \u201ca class of workers en-\ngaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\u201d2\n   Context confirms this reading. In Circuit City Stores, Inc.\nv. Adams, 532 U. S. 105 (2001), we considered whether \u00a71\nexempts all employment contracts or only those contracts\ninvolving \u201ctransportation workers.\u201d Id., at 109. In conclud-\ning that \u00a71 exempts only transportation-worker contracts,\nwe relied on two well-settled canons of statutory interpre-\ntation. First, we applied the meaningful-variation canon.\nSee, e.g., A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 170 (2012)\n(\u201c[W]here [a] document has used one term in one place, and\na materially different term in another, the presumption is\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 We recognize that the answer will not always be so plain when the\n\nclass of workers carries out duties further removed from the channels of\ninterstate commerce or the actual crossing of borders. Compare, e.g.,\nRittmann v. Amazon.com, Inc., 971 F. 3d 904, 915 (CA9 2020) (holding\nthat a class of \u201clast leg\u201d delivery drivers falls within \u00a71\u2019s exemption),\nwith, e.g., Wallace v. Grubhub Holdings, Inc., 970 F. 3d 798, 803 (CA7\n2020) (holding that food delivery drivers do not). In any event, we need\nnot address those questions to resolve this case.\n\f6            SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. v. SAXON\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the different term denotes a different idea\u201d). We ob-\nserved that Congress used \u201cmore open-ended formulations\u201d\nlike \u201c \u2018affecting\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018involving\u2019 \u201d commerce to signal \u201ccon-\ngressional intent to regulate to the outer limits of authority\nunder the Commerce Clause.\u201d Circuit City, 532 U. S., at\n115\u2013116, 118. By contrast, Congress used a \u201cnarrower\u201d\nphrase\u2014\u201c \u2018engaged in commerce\u2019 \u201d\u2014when it wanted to reg-\nulate short of those limits. Id., at 118. Second, we applied\nthe ejusdem generis canon, which instructs courts to inter-\npret a \u201cgeneral or collective term\u201d at the end of a list of spe-\ncific items in light of any \u201ccommon attribute[s]\u201d shared by\nthe specific items. Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552\nU. S. 214, 225 (2008). As applied to \u00a71, that canon coun-\nseled that the phrase \u201c \u2018class of workers engaged in . . . com-\nmerce\u2019 \u201d should be \u201ccontrolled and defined by reference\u201d to\nthe specific classes of \u201c \u2018seamen\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018railroad employees\u2019 \u201d\nthat precede it. Circuit City, 532 U. S., at 115.\n   Taken together, these canons showed that \u00a71 exempted\nonly contracts with transportation workers, rather than all\nemployees, from the FAA. See id., at 119. And, while we\ndid not provide a complete definition of \u201ctransportation\nworker,\u201d we indicated that any such worker must at least\nplay a direct and \u201cnecessary role in the free flow of goods\u201d\nacross borders. Id., at 121. Put another way, transporta-\ntion workers must be actively \u201cengaged in transportation\u201d\nof those goods across borders via the channels of foreign or\ninterstate commerce. Ibid.\n   Cargo loaders exhibit this central feature of a transpor-\ntation worker. As stated above, one who loads cargo on a\nplane bound for interstate transit is intimately involved\nwith the commerce (e.g., transportation) of that cargo.\n\u201c[T]here could be no doubt that [interstate] transportation\n[is] still in progress,\u201d and that a worker is engaged in that\ntransportation, when she is \u201cdoing the work of unloading\u201d\nor loading cargo from a vehicle carrying goods in interstate\ntransit. Erie R. Co. v. Shuart, 250 U. S. 465, 468 (1919).\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  A final piece of statutory context further confirms that\ncargo loading is part of cross-border \u201ccommerce.\u201d The first\nsentence of \u00a71 of the FAA defines exempted \u201cmaritime\ntransactions\u201d to include, among other things, \u201cagreements\nrelating to wharfage, supplies furnished vessels or repairs\nto vessels, collisions, or any other matters in foreign com-\nmerce.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of \u201cother\u201d in the\ncatchall provision indicates that Congress considered the\npreceding items to be \u201cmatters in foreign commerce.\u201d And\nagreements related to the enumerated \u201cmatte[r] in foreign\ncommerce\u201d of \u201cwharfage,\u201d to take one example, included\nagreements for mere access to a wharf\u2014which is simply a\ncargo-loading facility.      See Black\u2019s 1226 (wharfage:\n\u201c[m]oney paid for landing wares at a wharf, or for shipping\nor taking goods into a boat or barge from thence\u201d); Web-\nster\u2019s 2323 (similar); see also, e.g., Black\u2019s 1226 (wharf: \u201cA\nperpendicular bank or mound . . . extending some distance\ninto the water, for the convenience of lading and unlading\nships and other vessels\u201d). It stands to reason, then, that if\npayments to access a cargo-loading facility relate to a\n\u201cmatte[r] in foreign commerce,\u201d then an individual who ac-\ntually loads cargo on foreign-bound ships docked along a\nwharf is himself engaged in such commerce. Likewise, any\nclass of workers that loads or unloads cargo on or off air-\nplanes bound for a different State or country is \u201cengaged in\nforeign or interstate commerce.\u201d\n  In sum, text and context point to the same place: Work-\ners, like Saxon, who load cargo on and off airplanes belong\nto a \u201cclass of workers in foreign or interstate commerce.\u201d\n                            III\n  Both Saxon and Southwest proffer arguments that disa-\ngree with portions of our analysis. Neither of them con-\nvinces us to change course.\n                             A\n  For her part, Saxon thinks that we should define the\n\f8            SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. v. SAXON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cclass of workers\u201d as all airline employees who carry out the\n\u201ccustomary work\u201d of the airline, rather than cargo loaders\nmore specifically. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. That larger class of\nemployees potentially includes everyone from cargo loaders\nto shift schedulers to those who design Southwest\u2019s website.\nSee id., at 51\u201352; but cf. ibid. (conceding that those who run\nthe Southwest credit-card points program likely would not\ncount).\n   To support this reading, Saxon invokes the ejusdem gen-\neris canon. She argues, first, that \u201crailroad employees\u201d and\n\u201cseamen\u201d refer generally to employees in those industries\nproviding \u201cdominant mode[s] of transportation\u201d in inter-\nstate and foreign commerce. Brief for Respondent 17. She\nthen reasons, second, that all \u201cworkers who do the work of\nthe airlines have the same relationship to commerce as\nthose who do the work of the railroad or ship.\u201d Ibid.\n   Saxon\u2019s attempted invocation of ejusdem generis is una-\nvailing because it proceeds from the flawed premise that\n\u201cseamen\u201d and \u201crailroad employees\u201d are both industrywide\ncategories. The statute\u2019s use of \u201cseamen\u201d shows why that\npremise is mistaken. In 1925, seamen did not include all\nthose employed by companies engaged in maritime ship-\nping. Rather, seamen were only those \u201cwhose occupation\n[was] to assist in the management of ships at sea; a mari-\nner; a sailor; . . . any person (except masters, pilots, and ap-\nprentices duly indentured and registered) employed or en-\ngaged in any capacity on board any ship.\u201d Webster\u2019s 1906;\nsee also, e.g., Black\u2019s 1063 (seamen: \u201c[s]ailors; mariners;\npersons whose business is navigating ships\u201d).\n   Because \u201cseamen\u201d includes only those who work on board\na vessel, they constitute a subset of workers engaged in the\nmaritime shipping industry. Regardless of whether \u201crail-\nroad employees\u201d include all rail-transportation workers,\nthe narrow definition of \u201cseamen\u201d shows that the two terms\ncannot share a \u201ccommon attribute\u201d of identifying transpor-\ntation workers on an industrywide basis.

We therefore reject Saxon\u2019s argument that \u00a71 exempts\nvirtually all employees of major transportation providers.\n                              B\n   While Saxon defines the relevant class of workers too\nbroadly, Southwest construes \u00a71\u2019s catchall category\u2014\u201cany\nother class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate com-\nmerce\u201d\u2014too narrowly. The airline argues that only work-\ners who physically move goods or people across foreign or\ninternational boundaries\u2014pilots, ship crews, locomotive\nengineers, and the like\u2014are \u201cengaged in foreign or inter-\nstate commerce.\u201d So construed, \u00a71 does not exempt cargo\nloaders because they do not physically accompany freight\nacross state or international boundaries.\n   Southwest\u2019s reading rests on three arguments. None per-\nsuades us. First, taking its turn with ejusdem generis, the\nairline argues that because \u201cseamen\u201d are \u201cemployed on\nboard a vessel,\u201d McDermott Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S.\n337, 346 (1991) (emphasis added), and \u201c \u2018railroad employees\u2019\nis somewhat ambiguous,\u201d Brief for Petitioner 26, we should\nlimit the exempted class of railroad employees to those who\nare physically on board a locomotive as it crosses state lines.\nThen, having limited railroad employees in that way,\nSouthwest likewise urges us to narrow \u00a71\u2019s catchall provi-\nsion to exclude those airline-transportation workers, like\nSaxon and other cargo loaders, who do not ride aboard an\nairplane in interstate or foreign transit.\n   Southwest\u2019s application of ejusdem generis is as flawed as\nSaxon\u2019s. It purports to import a limitation from the defini-\ntion of \u201cseamen\u201d into the definition of \u201crailroad employees\u201d\nand then engrafts that limit onto the catchall provision.\nBut by conceding that \u201crailroad employees\u201d is ambiguous,\nSouthwest sinks its own ejusdem generis argument. Again,\nthe \u201cinference embodied in ejusdem generis [is] that Con-\ngress remained focused on [some] common attribute\u201d\nshared by the preceding list of specific items \u201cwhen it used\n\f10           SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. v. SAXON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe catchall phrase.\u201d Ali, 552 U. S., at 225. By recognizing\nthat the term \u201crailroad employees\u201d is at most ambiguous,\nSouthwest in effect concedes that it does not necessarily\nshare the attribute that Southwest would like us to read\ninto the catchall provision. Ejusdem generis neither de-\nmands nor permits that we limit a broadly worded catchall\nphrase based on an attribute that inheres in only one of the\nlist\u2019s preceding specific terms.\n   Second, Southwest argues that cargo loading is similar to\nother activities that this Court has found to lack a neces-\nsary nexus to interstate commerce in other contexts. But\nthe cases Southwest invokes all addressed activities far\nmore removed from interstate commerce than physically\nloading cargo directly on and off an airplane headed out of\nState. In Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U. S. 186\n(1974), for instance, this Court held that a firm making in-\ntrastate sales of asphalt was not \u201cengaged in [interstate]\ncommerce,\u201d id., at 194 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nmerely because the asphalt was later used to make inter-\nstate highways, id. at 198. Being only \u201cperceptibly con-\nnected to . . . instrumentalities\u201d of interstate commerce was\nnot enough. Ibid. Similarly, in United States v. American\nBuilding Maintenance Industries, 422 U. S. 271 (1975), this\nCourt held that \u201csimply supplying localized [janitorial] ser-\nvices to a corporation engaged in interstate commerce does\nnot satisfy the \u2018in commerce\u2019 requirement\u201d in \u00a77 of the Clay-\nton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a718. 422\nU. S., at 283. In each case, the Court explained that the\nrelevant firm was not \u201cengaged in\u201d interstate commerce be-\ncause it did not perform \u201cactivities within the flow of inter-\nstate commerce.\u201d Id. at 276 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Gulf Oil, 419 U. S., at 195.\n   But unlike those who sell asphalt for intrastate construc-\ntion or those who clean up after corporate employees, our\ncase law makes clear that airplane cargo loaders plainly do\nperform \u201cactivities within the flow of interstate commerce\u201d\n\f                 Cite as: 596 U.

See Burtch, 263 U. S., at 544.\n   Third, Southwest falls back on statutory purpose. It ob-\nserves that \u00a72 of the FAA broadly requires courts to enforce\narbitration agreements in any \u201ccontract evidencing a trans-\naction involving commerce,\u201d while \u00a71 provides only a nar-\nrower exemption. This structure, in its view, demonstrates\nthe FAA\u2019s \u201cproarbitration purposes\u201d and counsels in favor\nof an interpretation that errs on the side of fewer \u00a71 exemp-\ntions.

The Court of Appeals reversed. It held that \u201c[t]he act of loading\n  cargo onto a vehicle to be transported interstate is itself commerce, as\n  that term was understood at the time of the [FAA\u2019s] enactment in\n  1925.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">993 F. 3d 492</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494.\nHeld: Saxon belongs to a \u201cclass of workers engaged in foreign or inter-\n state commerce\u201d to which \u00a71\u2019s exemption applies.

SAXON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n         (1) The parties dispute how to define the relevant \u201cclass of work-\n    ers.\u201d Saxon argues that because the air transportation industry en-\n    gages in interstate commerce, airline employees, as a whole, constitute\n    a \u201cclass of workers\u201d covered by \u00a71. By contrast, Southwest maintains\n    that the relevant class includes only those airline employees actually\n    engaged day-to-day in interstate commerce. This Court rejects Saxon\u2019s\n    industrywide approach. By referring to \u201cworkers\u201d rather than \u201cem-\n    ployees,\u201d the FAA directs attention to \u201cthe performance of work.\u201d New\n    Prime Inc. v. Oliveira, 586 U. S. ___, ___. And the word \u201cengaged\u201d sim-\n    ilarly emphasizes the actual work that class members typically carry\n    out. Saxon is therefore a member of a \u201cclass of workers\u201d based on what\n    she frequently does at Southwest\u2014that is, physically loading and un-\n    loading cargo on and off airplanes\u2014and not on what Southwest does\n    generally. Pp. 3\u20134.\n         (2) The parties also dispute whether the class of airplane cargo\n    loaders is \u201cengaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\u201d It is. To be\n    \u201cengaged\u201d in \u201ccommerce\u201d means to be directly involved in transporting\n    goods across state or international borders. Thus, any class of workers\n    so engaged falls within \u00a71\u2019s exemption. Airplane cargo loaders are\n    such a class.\n       Context confirms this reading. In Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,\n    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118415\"><a href=\"/opinion/118415/circuit-city-stores-inc-v-adams/\">532 U. S. 105</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Court applied two well-settled canons of statutory\n    interpretation to hold that \u00a71 exempted only \u201ctransportation workers,\u201d\n    rather than all employees. The Court indicated that any such ex-\n    empted worker must at least play a direct and \u201cnecessary role in the\n    free flow of goods\u201d across borders. Id., at 121. Cargo loaders exhibit\n    this central feature of a transportation worker.\n       A final piece of statutory context further confirms that cargo loading\n    is part of cross-border \u201ccommerce.\u201d Section 1 of the FAA defines ex-\n    empted \u201cmaritime transactions\u201d to include \u201cagreements relating to\n    wharfage . . . or any other matters in foreign commerce.\u201d Thus, if an\n    \u201cagreemen[t] relating to wharfage\u201d\u2014i.e., money paid to access a cargo-\n    loading facility\u2014is a \u201cmatte[r] in foreign commerce,\u201d it stands to rea-\n    son that an individual who actually loads cargo on vehicles traveling\n    across borders is himself engaged in such commerce. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Both parties proffer arguments disagreeing with this analysis,\n    but none is convincing. Pp. 7\u201311.\n         (1) Saxon thinks the relevant \u201cclass of workers\u201d should include all\n    airline employees, not just cargo loaders. For support, she argues that\n    \u201crailroad employees\u201d and \u201cseamen\u201d\u2014two classes of workers listed im-\n    mediately before \u00a71\u2019s catchall provision\u2014refer generally to employees\n    in those industries. Saxon\u2019s premise is flawed. \u201cSeamen\u201d is not an\n    industrywide category but instead a subset of workers engaged in the\n    maritime shipping industry. For example, \u201cseamen\u201d did not include\n\f                     Cite as: 596 U.

Pp. 8\u20139.\n       (2) Southwest\u2019s three counterarguments all fail. First, Southwest\n  narrowly construes \u00a71\u2019s catchall category\u2014\u201cany other class of workers\n  engaged in foreign or interstate commerce\u201d\u2014to include only workers\n  who physically transport goods or people across foreign or interna-\n  tional boundaries. Southwest relies on the definition of \u201cseamen\u201d as\n  only those \u201cemployed on board a vessel,\u201d McDermott Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Wilan-\n  der, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112527\"><a href=\"/opinion/112527/mcdermott-intl-inc-v-wilander/\">498 U. S. 337</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346, and argues that the catchall category should\n  be read along the same lines to exclude airline workers, like Saxon,\n  who do not ride aboard an airplane in interstate or foreign transit. But\n  Southwest\u2019s acknowledgment that the statute\u2019s reference to \u201crailroad\n  employees\u201d is somewhat ambiguous in effect concedes that the three\n  statutory categories in \u00a71\u2014\u201cseamen, railroad employees, or any other\n  class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce\u201d\u2014do not\n  share the attribute that Southwest would like read into the catchall\n  provision. Well-settled canons of statutory interpretation neither de-\n  mand nor permit limiting a broadly worded catchall phrase based on\n  an attribute that inheres in only one of the list\u2019s preceding specific\n  terms. Second, Southwest argues that cargo loading is similar to other\n  activities that this Court has found to lack a necessary nexus to inter-\n  state commerce in other contexts. But the cases Southwest invokes all\n  addressed activities far more removed from interstate commerce than\n  physically loading cargo directly on and off an airplane headed out of\n  State. See, e.g., Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109118\"><a href=\"/opinion/109118/gulf-oil-corp-v-copp-paving-co/\">419 U.

Fi-\n  nally, Southwest argues that the FAA\u2019s \u201cproarbitration purposes\u201d\n  counsel in favor of an interpretation that errs on the side of fewer \u00a71\n  exemptions. Here, however, plain text suffices to show that airplane\n  cargo loaders, and thus ramp supervisors who frequently load and un-\n  load cargo, are exempt from the FAA\u2019s scope under \u00a71.

Saxon\nis therefore a member of a \u201cclass of workers\u201d based on what\nshe does at Southwest, not what Southwest does generally.\n   On that point, Southwest has not meaningfully contested\nthat ramp supervisors like Saxon frequently load and un-\nload cargo. See 993 F. 3d, at 494, 497 (noting Saxon\u2019s \u201cun-\ncontroverted declaration assert[ing] that she and the other\nramp supervisors . . . frequently fill in as ramp agents\u201d for\nup to three shifts per week). Thus, as relevant here, we\naccept that Saxon belongs to a class of workers who physi-\ncally load and unload cargo on and off airplanes on a fre-\nquent basis.1\n                              B\n  Second, the parties dispute whether that class of airplane\ncargo loaders is \u201cengaged in foreign or interstate commerce\u201d\nunder \u00a71.

In conclud-\ning that \u00a71 exempts only transportation-worker contracts,\nwe relied on two well-settled canons of statutory interpre-\ntation. First, we applied the meaningful-variation canon.\nSee, e.g., A. Scalia & B.

Compare, e.g.,\nRittmann v. Amazon.com, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">971 F. 3d 904</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 915 (CA9 2020) (holding\nthat a class of \u201clast leg\u201d delivery drivers falls within \u00a71\u2019s exemption),\nwith, e.g., Wallace v.

We ob-\nserved that Congress used \u201cmore open-ended formulations\u201d\nlike \u201c \u2018affecting\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018involving\u2019 \u201d commerce to signal \u201ccon-\ngressional intent to regulate to the outer limits of authority\nunder the Commerce Clause.\u201d Circuit City, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118415\"><a href=\"/opinion/118415/circuit-city-stores-inc-v-adams/\">532 U.

See id., at 119. And, while we\ndid not provide a complete definition of \u201ctransportation\nworker,\u201d we indicated that any such worker must at least\nplay a direct and \u201cnecessary role in the free flow of goods\u201d\nacross borders. Id., at 121. Put another way, transporta-\ntion workers must be actively \u201cengaged in transportation\u201d\nof those goods across borders via the channels of foreign or\ninterstate commerce. Ibid.\n   Cargo loaders exhibit this central feature of a transpor-\ntation worker. As stated above, one who loads cargo on a\nplane bound for interstate transit is intimately involved\nwith the commerce (e.g., transportation) of that cargo.\n\u201c[T]here could be no doubt that [interstate] transportation\n[is] still in progress,\u201d and that a worker is engaged in that\ntransportation, when she is \u201cdoing the work of unloading\u201d\nor loading cargo from a vehicle carrying goods in interstate\ntransit.

S. ____ (2022)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  A final piece of statutory context further confirms that\ncargo loading is part of cross-border \u201ccommerce.\u201d The first\nsentence of \u00a71 of the FAA defines exempted \u201cmaritime\ntransactions\u201d to include, among other things, \u201cagreements\nrelating to wharfage, supplies furnished vessels or repairs\nto vessels, collisions, or any other matters in foreign com-\nmerce.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of \u201cother\u201d in the\ncatchall provision indicates that Congress considered the\npreceding items to be \u201cmatters in foreign commerce.\u201d And\nagreements related to the enumerated \u201cmatte[r] in foreign\ncommerce\u201d of \u201cwharfage,\u201d to take one example, included\nagreements for mere access to a wharf\u2014which is simply a\ncargo-loading facility.      See Black\u2019s 1226 (wharfage:\n\u201c[m]oney paid for landing wares at a wharf, or for shipping\nor taking goods into a boat or barge from thence\u201d); Web-\nster\u2019s 2323 (similar); see also, e.g., Black\u2019s 1226 (wharf: \u201cA\nperpendicular bank or mound . . . extending some distance\ninto the water, for the convenience of lading and unlading\nships and other vessels\u201d). It stands to reason, then, that if\npayments to access a cargo-loading facility relate to a\n\u201cmatte[r] in foreign commerce,\u201d then an individual who ac-\ntually loads cargo on foreign-bound ships docked along a\nwharf is himself engaged in such commerce. Likewise, any\nclass of workers that loads or unloads cargo on or off air-\nplanes bound for a different State or country is \u201cengaged in\nforeign or interstate commerce.\u201d\n  In sum, text and context point to the same place: Work-\ners, like Saxon, who load cargo on and off airplanes belong\nto a \u201cclass of workers in foreign or interstate commerce.\u201d\n                            III\n  Both Saxon and Southwest proffer arguments that disa-\ngree with portions of our analysis. Neither of them con-\nvinces us to change course.\n                             A\n  For her part, Saxon thinks that we should define the\n\f8            SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. v. SAXON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cclass of workers\u201d as all airline employees who carry out the\n\u201ccustomary work\u201d of the airline, rather than cargo loaders\nmore specifically. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. That larger class of\nemployees potentially includes everyone from cargo loaders\nto shift schedulers to those who design Southwest\u2019s website.\nSee id., at 51\u201352; but cf. ibid. (conceding that those who run\nthe Southwest credit-card points program likely would not\ncount).\n   To support this reading, Saxon invokes the ejusdem gen-\neris canon. She argues, first, that \u201crailroad employees\u201d and\n\u201cseamen\u201d refer generally to employees in those industries\nproviding \u201cdominant mode[s] of transportation\u201d in inter-\nstate and foreign commerce. Brief for Respondent 17. She\nthen reasons, second, that all \u201cworkers who do the work of\nthe airlines have the same relationship to commerce as\nthose who do the work of the railroad or ship.\u201d Ibid.\n   Saxon\u2019s attempted invocation of ejusdem generis is una-\nvailing because it proceeds from the flawed premise that\n\u201cseamen\u201d and \u201crailroad employees\u201d are both industrywide\ncategories. The statute\u2019s use of \u201cseamen\u201d shows why that\npremise is mistaken. In 1925, seamen did not include all\nthose employed by companies engaged in maritime ship-\nping. Rather, seamen were only those \u201cwhose occupation\n[was] to assist in the management of ships at sea; a mari-\nner; a sailor; . . . any person (except masters, pilots, and ap-\nprentices duly indentured and registered) employed or en-\ngaged in any capacity on board any ship.\u201d Webster\u2019s 1906;\nsee also, e.g., Black\u2019s 1063 (seamen: \u201c[s]ailors; mariners;\npersons whose business is navigating ships\u201d).\n   Because \u201cseamen\u201d includes only those who work on board\na vessel, they constitute a subset of workers engaged in the\nmaritime shipping industry. Regardless of whether \u201crail-\nroad employees\u201d include all rail-transportation workers,\nthe narrow definition of \u201cseamen\u201d shows that the two terms\ncannot share a \u201ccommon attribute\u201d of identifying transpor-\ntation workers on an industrywide basis. Ali, 552 U. S., at\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n224. We therefore reject Saxon\u2019s argument that \u00a71 exempts\nvirtually all employees of major transportation providers.\n                              B\n   While Saxon defines the relevant class of workers too\nbroadly, Southwest construes \u00a71\u2019s catchall category\u2014\u201cany\nother class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate com-\nmerce\u201d\u2014too narrowly. The airline argues that only work-\ners who physically move goods or people across foreign or\ninternational boundaries\u2014pilots, ship crews, locomotive\nengineers, and the like\u2014are \u201cengaged in foreign or inter-\nstate commerce.\u201d So construed, \u00a71 does not exempt cargo\nloaders because they do not physically accompany freight\nacross state or international boundaries.\n   Southwest\u2019s reading rests on three arguments. None per-\nsuades us. First, taking its turn with ejusdem generis, the\nairline argues that because \u201cseamen\u201d are \u201cemployed on\nboard a vessel,\u201d McDermott Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Wilander, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112527\"><a href=\"/opinion/112527/mcdermott-intl-inc-v-wilander/\">498 U.

It purports to import a limitation from the defini-\ntion of \u201cseamen\u201d into the definition of \u201crailroad employees\u201d\nand then engrafts that limit onto the catchall provision.\nBut by conceding that \u201crailroad employees\u201d is ambiguous,\nSouthwest sinks its own ejusdem generis argument. Again,\nthe \u201cinference embodied in ejusdem generis [is] that Con-\ngress remained focused on [some] common attribute\u201d\nshared by the preceding list of specific items \u201cwhen it used\n\f10           SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. v. SAXON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe catchall phrase.\u201d Ali, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145834\"><a href=\"/opinion/145834/ali-v-federal-bureau-of-prisons/\">552 U. S., at 225</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. By recognizing\nthat the term \u201crailroad employees\u201d is at most ambiguous,\nSouthwest in effect concedes that it does not necessarily\nshare the attribute that Southwest would like us to read\ninto the catchall provision. Ejusdem generis neither de-\nmands nor permits that we limit a broadly worded catchall\nphrase based on an attribute that inheres in only one of the\nlist\u2019s preceding specific terms.\n   Second, Southwest argues that cargo loading is similar to\nother activities that this Court has found to lack a neces-\nsary nexus to interstate commerce in other contexts. But\nthe cases Southwest invokes all addressed activities far\nmore removed from interstate commerce than physically\nloading cargo directly on and off an airplane headed out of\nState.

Applicants claim that \u00a77 of HB20 interferes with\ntheir exercise of \u201ceditorial discretion,\u201d and they maintain\nthat this interference violates their right \u201cnot to dissemi-\nnate speech generated by others.\u201d Application 19. Under\nsome circumstances, we have recognized the right of organ-\nizations to refuse to host the speech of others. See Hurley\nv. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Bos-\nton, Inc., 515 U. S. 557 (1995) (parade organizer); Miami\nHerald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241 (1974)\n(newspaper). But we have rejected such claims in other cir-\ncumstances. For example, in PruneYard Shopping Center\nv. Robins, 447 U. S. 74 (1980), we rejected the argument\nthat the owner of a shopping mall had \u201ca First Amendment\nright not to be forced by the State to use his property as a\nforum for the speech of others.\u201d Id., at 85. And in Turner\nBroadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622 (1994), we\ndeclined to apply strict scrutiny to rules that \u201cinterfere[d]\nwith cable operators\u2019 editorial discretion by compelling\nthem to offer carriage to a certain minimum number of\nbroadcast stations.\u201d Id., at 643\u2013644; see generally E. Vo-\nlokh, Treating Social Media Platforms Like Common Carri-\ners? 1 J. Free Speech Law 377 (2021).\n   It is not at all obvious how our existing precedents, which\npredate the age of the internet, should apply to large social\nmedia companies, but Texas argues that its law is permis-\nsible under our case law. First, Texas contends that \u00a77 does\nnot require social media platforms to host any particular\nmessage but only to refrain from discrimination against a\nuser\u2019s speech on the basis of \u201cviewpoint,\u201d App. 49a, and in\nthis respect the statute may be a permissible attempt to\nprevent \u201crepression of [the freedom of speech] by private in-\nterests,\u201d Associated Press v. United States, 326 U. S. 1, 20\n(1945). Second, Texas argues that HB20 applies only to\nplatforms that hold themselves out as \u201copen to the public,\u201d\n\f4                     NETCHOICE, LLC v. PAXTON\n\n                            ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nApp. 40a, and as neutral forums for the speech of others.2\nThese representations suggest that the covered social me-\ndia platforms\u2014like the cable operators in Turner\u2014do not\ngenerally \u201c \u2018convey ideas or messages [that they have] en-\ndorsed.\u2019 \u201d Hurley, 515 U. S., at 576. Third, since HB20 is\nlimited to companies with \u201c50 million active users in the\nUnited States,\u201d App. 41a, Texas argues that the law applies\nto only those entities that possess some measure of common\ncarrier-like market power and that this power gives them\nan \u201copportunity to shut out [disfavored] speakers.\u201d 515\nU. S., at 577; see also Biden v. Knight First Amendment In-\nstitute at Columbia Univ., 593 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2021)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 6\u20137).\n   If anything, Texas submits, its arguments regarding the\nconstitutionality of \u00a72\u2019s disclosure requirements are even\nstronger. The State notes that we have upheld laws requir-\ning that businesses disclose \u201cpurely factual and uncontro-\nversial information about the terms under which [their] ser-\nvices will be available,\u201d so long as those requirements are\nnot \u201cunjustified or unduly burdensome.\u201d Zauderer v. Office\nof Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S.\n626, 651 (1985). If we were to agree with the applicants\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Texas also suggests that applicants\u2019 position in this litigation is in\n\nconflict or tension with the positions of its members in cases regarding\nthe interpretation of \u00a7230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996,\n47 U. S. C. \u00a7230. That statute directs, among other things, that \u201c[n]o\nprovider . . . of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the\npublisher or speaker of any information provided by another information\ncontent provider.\u201d \u00a7230(c)(1). Texas claims that \u201c[w]hen the platforms\nresort to section 230\u2019s protections . . . they are relying on Congress\u2019s de-\nterminations that they are not the \u2018publisher\u2019 of their users\u2019 content, 47\nU. S. C. \u00a7230(c)(1), and that they are not \u2018responsible\u2019 for that content in\nany respect, id. \u00a7230(f )(3).\u201d Response 36. And Texas suggests that,\ngiven that many of applicants\u2019 members have emphasized their \u201c \u2018neu-\ntral[ity]\u2019 \u201d and their function as \u201c \u2018conduits\u2019 \u201d for the speech of their users\n(see id., at 37\u201338, and nn. 11\u201318), the Court should view their assertions\nof a First Amendment right to engage in \u201c \u2018editorial discretion\u2019 \u201d with\nsome skepticism.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            5\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\narguments, the decision could have widespread implica-\ntions with regard to other disclosures required by federal\nand state law.\n   The procedural posture of this case also counsels against\nvacatur of the stay. Applicants sought pre-enforcement re-\nview of the statute in federal court, so it is not clear how\nstate courts would interpret this statute if it were applied\nto applicants\u2019 businesses; nor has it been resolved which\nplatforms are covered by the law. Compare Respondent\u2019s\nOpposition to Application to Vacate Stay 1, n. 1 (Response),\nwith Application 11. The statute also includes a broad sev-\nerability provision, see App. 52a\u201354a, so vacating the stay\nrequires a determination that applicants are likely to be\nable to show that every provision of HB20 is unconstitu-\ntional. What is more, the attorney general\u2019s enforcement\npower is limited to prospective relief. See id., at 52a (au-\nthorizing the attorney general to seek \u201cinjunctive relief \u201d\nand, if granted, \u201ccosts,\u201d \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d and\n\u201creasonable investigative costs\u201d). In this respect, this stat-\nute is quite different from one that authorizes imprison-\nment or severe monetary penalties for those who refuse to\ncomply. See, e.g., Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 127, 131\n(1908) (noting that a law\u2019s \u201cpenalties\u201d were \u201cso drastic\u201d that\nno one could test the law\u2019s constitutionality \u201cexcept at the\nrisk of confiscation of its property, and the imprisonment\nfor long terms in jails and penitentiaries\u201d). Should the at-\ntorney general bring an enforcement action for injunctive\nrelief, applicants would then have an opportunity to argue\nthat the statute violates the First Amendment, whether fa-\ncially or as applied to them.\n   I reiterate that I have not formed a definitive view on the\nnovel legal questions that arise from Texas\u2019s decision to ad-\ndress the \u201cchanging social and economic\u201d conditions it per-\nceives. New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311\n(1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). But precisely because of\nthat, I am not comfortable intervening at this point in the\n\f6                NETCHOICE, LLC v. PAXTON\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nproceedings. While I can understand the Court\u2019s apparent\ndesire to delay enforcement of HB20 while the appeal is\npending, the preliminary injunction entered by the District\nCourt was itself a significant intrusion on state sovereignty,\nand Texas should not be required to seek preclearance from\nthe federal courts before its laws go into effect. The Court\nof Appeals, after briefing and oral argument, concluded that\nthe District Court\u2019s order should be stayed, and a decision\non the merits can be expected in the near future. I would\nnot disturb the Court of Appeals\u2019 informed judgment about\napplicants\u2019 entitlement to a stay.\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                     Cite as: 596 U.

Applicants sought pre-enforcement re-\nview of the statute in federal court, so it is not clear how\nstate courts would interpret this statute if it were applied\nto applicants\u2019 businesses; nor has it been resolved which\nplatforms are covered by the law. Compare Respondent\u2019s\nOpposition to Application to Vacate Stay 1, n. 1 (Response),\nwith Application 11. The statute also includes a broad sev-\nerability provision, see App. 52a\u201354a, so vacating the stay\nrequires a determination that applicants are likely to be\nable to show that every provision of HB20 is unconstitu-\ntional. What is more, the attorney general\u2019s enforcement\npower is limited to prospective relief. See id., at 52a (au-\nthorizing the attorney general to seek \u201cinjunctive relief \u201d\nand, if granted, \u201ccosts,\u201d \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d and\n\u201creasonable investigative costs\u201d). In this respect, this stat-\nute is quite different from one that authorizes imprison-\nment or severe monetary penalties for those who refuse to\ncomply.

Argued March 21, 2022\u2014Decided May 23, 2022\nPetitioner Robyn Morgan worked as an hourly employee at a Taco Bell\n  franchise owned by respondent Sundance. When applying for the job,\n  Morgan signed an agreement to arbitrate any employment dispute.\n  Despite that agreement, Morgan filed a nationwide collective action\n  asserting that Sundance had violated federal law regarding overtime\n  payment. Sundance initially defended against the lawsuit as if no ar-\n  bitration agreement existed, filing a motion to dismiss (which the Dis-\n  trict Court denied) and engaging in mediation (which was unsuccess-\n  ful). Then\u2014nearly eight months after Morgan filed the lawsuit\u2014\n  Sundance moved to stay the litigation and compel arbitration under\n  the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Morgan opposed, arguing that\n  Sundance had waived its right to arbitrate by litigating for so long.\n     The courts below applied Eighth Circuit precedent, under which a\n  party waives its right to arbitration if it knew of the right; \u201cacted in-\n  consistently with that right\u201d; and \u201cprejudiced the other party by its\n  inconsistent actions.\u201d Erdman Co. v. Phoenix Land & Acquisition,\n  LLC, 650 F. 3d 1115, 1117. The prejudice requirement is not a feature\n  of federal waiver law generally. The Eighth Circuit adopted that re-\n  quirement because of the \u201cfederal policy favoring arbitration.\u201d Id., at\n  1120. Other courts have rejected such a requirement. This Court\n  granted certiorari to resolve the split over whether federal courts may\n  adopt an arbitration-specific waiver rule demanding a showing of prej-\n  udice.\nHeld: The Eighth Circuit erred in conditioning a waiver of the right to\n arbitrate on a showing of prejudice. Federal courts have generally re-\n solved cases like this one as a matter of federal law, using the termi-\n nology of waiver. The parties dispute whether that framework is cor-\n rect. Assuming without deciding that it is, federal courts may not\n\f2                     MORGAN v. SUNDANCE, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    create arbitration-specific variants of federal procedural rules, like\n    those concerning waiver, based on the FAA\u2019s \u201cpolicy favoring arbitra-\n    tion.\u201d Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460\n    U. S. 1, 24. That policy \u201cis merely an acknowledgment of the FAA\u2019s\n    commitment to overrule the judiciary\u2019s longstanding refusal to enforce\n    agreements to arbitrate and to place such agreements upon the same\n    footing as other contracts.\u201d Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U. S.\n    287, 302 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, a court\n    must hold a party to its arbitration contract just as the court would to\n    any other kind. But a court may not devise novel rules to favor arbi-\n    tration over litigation. See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470\n    U. S. 213, 218\u2013221. The federal policy is about treating arbitration\n    contracts like all others, not about fostering arbitration.\n       The text of the FAA makes clear that courts are not to create arbi-\n    tration-specific procedural rules like the one here. Section 6 of the FAA\n    provides that any application under the statute\u2014including an appli-\n    cation to stay litigation or compel arbitration\u2014\u201cshall be made and\n    heard in the manner provided by law for the making and hearing of\n    motions\u201d (unless the statute says otherwise). A directive to treat arbi-\n    tration applications \u201cin the manner provided by law\u201d for all other mo-\n    tions is simply a command to apply the usual federal procedural rules,\n    including any rules relating to a motion\u2019s timeliness. Because the\n    usual federal rule of waiver does not include a prejudice requirement,\n    Section 6 instructs that prejudice is not a condition of finding that a\n    party waived its right to stay litigation or compel arbitration under the\n    FAA.\n       Stripped of its prejudice requirement, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s current\n    waiver inquiry would focus on Sundance\u2019s conduct. Did Sundance\n    knowingly relinquish the right to arbitrate by acting inconsistently\n    with that right? On remand, the Court of Appeals may resolve that\n    question, or determine that a different procedural framework (such as\n    forfeiture) is appropriate. The Court\u2019s sole holding today is that it may\n    not make up a new procedural rule based on the FAA\u2019s \u201cpolicy favoring\n    arbitration.\u201d Pp. 4\u20137.\n992 F. 3d 711, vacated and remanded.\n\n    KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n\f                        Cite as: 596 U.

SUNDANCE, INC.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n                                  [May 23, 2022]\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   When a party who has agreed to arbitrate a dispute in-\nstead brings a lawsuit, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)\nentitles the defendant to file an application to stay the liti-\ngation. See 9 U. S. C. \u00a73. But defendants do not always\nseek that relief right away. Sometimes, they engage in\nmonths, or even years, of litigation\u2014filing motions to dis-\nmiss, answering complaints, and discussing settlement\u2014\nbefore deciding they would fare better in arbitration. When\nthat happens, the court faces a question: Has the defend-\nant\u2019s request to switch to arbitration come too late?\n   Most Courts of Appeals have answered that question by\napplying a rule of waiver specific to the arbitration context.\nUsually, a federal court deciding whether a litigant has\nwaived a right does not ask if its actions caused harm. But\nwhen the right concerns arbitration, courts have held, a\nfinding of harm is essential: A party can waive its arbitra-\ntion right by litigating only when its conduct has prejudiced\nthe other side. That special rule, the courts say, derives\nfrom the FAA\u2019s \u201cpolicy favoring arbitration.\u201d\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether the FAA author-\n\f2                MORGAN v. SUNDANCE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nizes federal courts to create such an arbitration-specific pro-\ncedural rule. We hold it does not.\n                                I\n   Petitioner Robyn Morgan worked as an hourly employee\nat a Taco Bell franchise owned by respondent Sundance.\nWhen applying for the job, she signed an agreement to \u201cuse\nconfidential binding arbitration, instead of going to court,\u201d\nto resolve any employment dispute. App. 77.\n   Despite that agreement, Morgan brought a nationwide\ncollective action against Sundance in federal court for vio-\nlations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Under that stat-\nute, employers must pay overtime to covered employees\nwho work more than 40 hours in a week. See 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7207(a). Morgan alleged that Sundance routinely flouted\nthe Act\u2014most notably, by recording hours worked in one\nweek as instead worked in another to prevent any week\u2019s\ntotal from exceeding 40. See App. 12.\n   Sundance initially defended itself against Morgan\u2019s suit\nas if no arbitration agreement existed. Sundance first\nmoved to dismiss the suit as duplicative of a collective ac-\ntion previously brought by other Taco Bell employees. In\nthat motion, Sundance suggested that Morgan either \u201cjoin\u201d\nthe earlier suit or \u201crefile her claim on an individual basis.\u201d\nId., at 39. But Morgan declined the invitation to litigate\ndifferently, and the District Court denied Sundance\u2019s mo-\ntion. Sundance then answered Morgan\u2019s complaint, assert-\ning 14 affirmative defenses\u2014but none mentioning the arbi-\ntration agreement. Soon afterward, Sundance met in a\njoint mediation with the named plaintiffs in both collective\nactions. The other suit settled, but Morgan\u2019s did not. She\nand Sundance began to talk about scheduling the rest of the\nlitigation.\n   And then\u2014nearly eight months after the suit\u2019s filing\u2014\nSundance changed course. It moved to stay the litigation\nand compel arbitration under Sections 3 and 4 of the FAA.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Morgan\nopposed the motion, arguing that Sundance had waived its\nright to arbitrate by litigating for so long. Sundance re-\nsponded that it had asserted its right as soon as this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, 587 U. S. ___ (2019),\nclarified that the arbitration would proceed on a bilateral\n(not collective) basis.\n   The courts below applied Eighth Circuit precedent to de-\ncide the waiver issue. See 992 F. 3d 711, 713\u2013715 (2021);\nNo. 4:18\u2013cv\u2013316 (ND Iowa, June 28, 2019), App. to Pet. for\nCert. 21\u201333. Under that Circuit\u2019s test, a party waives its\ncontractual right to arbitration if it knew of the right; \u201cacted\ninconsistently with that right\u201d; and\u2014critical here\u2014\u201cpreju-\ndiced the other party by its inconsistent actions.\u201d Erdman\nCo. v. Phoenix Land & Acquisition, LLC, 650 F. 3d 1115,\n1117 (CA8 2011). The prejudice requirement, as explained\nlater, is not a feature of federal waiver law generally. See\ninfra, at 5. The Eighth Circuit adopted the requirement in\nthe arbitration context because of the \u201cfederal policy favor-\ning arbitration.\u201d Erdman, 650 F. 3d, at 1120; see id., at\n1117.\n   Although the District Court found the prejudice require-\nment satisfied, the Court of Appeals disagreed and sent\nMorgan\u2019s case to arbitration. The panel majority reasoned\nthat the parties had not yet begun formal discovery or con-\ntested any matters \u201cgoing to the merits.\u201d 992 F. 3d, at 715.\nJudge Colloton dissented.

More fundamentally, he raised doubts about the\nEighth Circuit\u2019s prejudice requirement. Outside the arbi-\ntration context, Judge Colloton observed, prejudice is not\nneeded for waiver. See id., at 716. In line with that general\nprinciple, he continued, \u201csome circuits allow a finding of\n\f4                   MORGAN v.

S. ___ (2021), to resolve\nthat circuit split. Nine circuits, including the Eighth, have\ninvoked \u201cthe strong federal policy favoring arbitration\u201d in\nsupport of an arbitration-specific waiver rule demanding a\nshowing of prejudice.1 Two circuits have rejected that rule.2\nWe do too.\n                              II\n  We decide today a single issue, responsive to the predom-\ninant analysis in the Courts of Appeals, rather than to all\nthe arguments the parties have raised. In their briefing,\nthe parties have disagreed about the role state law might\nplay in resolving when a party\u2019s litigation conduct results\nin the loss of a contractual right to arbitrate. The parties\nhave also quarreled about whether to understand that in-\nquiry as involving rules of waiver, forfeiture, estoppel,\nlaches, or procedural timeliness. We do not address those\nissues. The Courts of Appeals, including the Eighth Circuit,\nhave generally resolved cases like this one as a matter of\nfederal law, using the terminology of waiver. For today, we\nassume without deciding they are right to do so. We con-\nsider only the next step in their reasoning: that they may\ncreate arbitration-specific variants of federal procedural\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Joca-Roca Real Estate, LLC v.

Cone Memorial Hos-\npital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24 (1983). They\ncannot. For that reason, the Eighth Circuit was wrong to\ncondition a waiver of the right to arbitrate on a showing of\nprejudice.\n   Outside the arbitration context, a federal court assessing\nwaiver does not generally ask about prejudice. Waiver, we\nhave said, \u201cis the intentional relinquishment or abandon-\nment of a known right.\u201d United States v. Olano, 507 U. S.\n725, 733 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). To de-\ncide whether a waiver has occurred, the court focuses on the\nactions of the person who held the right; the court seldom\nconsiders the effects of those actions on the opposing party.\nThat analysis applies to the waiver of a contractual right,\nas of any other. As Judge Colloton noted in dissent below,\na contractual waiver \u201cnormally is effective\u201d without proof of\n\u201cdetrimental reliance.\u201d 992 F. 3d, at 716; see Cabinetree of\nWisconsin, Inc. v. Kraftmaid Cabinetry, Inc., 50 F. 3d 388,\n390 (CA7 1995) (Posner, C. J., for the Court). So in demand-\ning that kind of proof before finding the waiver of an arbi-\ntration right, the Eighth Circuit applies a rule found no-\nwhere else\u2014consider it a bespoke rule of waiver for\narbitration.\n   The Eighth Circuit\u2019s arbitration-specific rule derives\nfrom a decades-old Second Circuit decision, which in turn\ngrounded the rule in the FAA\u2019s policy. See Carcich v. Rederi\nA/B Nordie, 389 F. 2d 692, 696 (CA2 1968); Erdman, 650\nF. 3d, at 1120, n. 4 (\u201ctrac[ing] the origins of [the Eighth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s] prejudice requirement to Carcich\u201d). \u201c[T]here is,\u201d the\nSecond Circuit declared, \u201can overriding federal policy favor-\ning arbitration.\u201d Carcich, 389 F. 3d, at 696. For that rea-\nson, the court held, waiver of the right to arbitrate \u201cis not\nto be lightly inferred\u201d: \u201c[M]ere delay\u201d in seeking a stay of\nlitigation, \u201cwithout some resultant prejudice\u201d to the oppos-\ning party, \u201ccannot carry the day.\u201d Ibid. Over the years,\n\f6                MORGAN v. SUNDANCE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nboth that rule and its reasoning spread. Circuit after circuit\n(with just a couple of holdouts) justified adopting a preju-\ndice requirement based on the \u201cliberal national policy favor-\ning arbitration.\u201d Carolina Throwing Co. v. S & E Novelty\nCorp., 442 F. 2d 329, 331 (CA4 1971) (per curiam); see, e.g.,\nPaineWebber Inc. v. Faragalli, 61 F. 3d 1063, 1068\u20131069\n(CA3 1995); Shinto Shipping Co. v. Fibrex & Shipping Co.,\nInc., 572 F. 2d 1328, 1330 (CA9 1978).\n   But the FAA\u2019s \u201cpolicy favoring arbitration\u201d does not au-\nthorize federal courts to invent special, arbitration-preferring\nprocedural rules. Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 24. Our fre-\nquent use of that phrase connotes something different.\n\u201cTh[e] policy,\u201d we have explained, \u201cis merely an acknowl-\nedgment of the FAA\u2019s commitment to overrule the judici-\nary\u2019s longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbi-\ntrate and to place such agreements upon the same footing\nas other contracts.\u201d Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561\nU. S. 287, 302 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nOr in another formulation: The policy is to make \u201carbitra-\ntion agreements as enforceable as other contracts, but not\nmore so.\u201d Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co.,\n388 U. S. 395, 404, n. 12 (1967). Accordingly, a court must\nhold a party to its arbitration contract just as the court\nwould to any other kind. But a court may not devise novel\nrules to favor arbitration over litigation. See Dean Witter\nReynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 218\u2013221 (1985). If an\nordinary procedural rule\u2014whether of waiver or forfeiture\nor what-have-you\u2014would counsel against enforcement of\nan arbitration contract, then so be it. The federal policy is\nabout treating arbitration contracts like all others, not\nabout fostering arbitration. See ibid.; National Foundation\nfor Cancer Research v. A. G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., 821\nF. 2d 772, 774 (CADC 1987) (\u201cThe Supreme Court has made\nclear\u201d that the FAA\u2019s policy \u201cis based upon the enforcement\nof contract, rather than a preference for arbitration as an\nalternative dispute resolution mechanism\u201d).\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   And indeed, the text of the FAA makes clear that courts\nare not to create arbitration-specific procedural rules like\nthe one we address here. Section 6 of the FAA provides that\nany application under the statute\u2014including an applica-\ntion to stay litigation or compel arbitration\u2014\u201cshall be made\nand heard in the manner provided by law for the making\nand hearing of motions\u201d (unless the statute says otherwise).\nA directive to a federal court to treat arbitration applica-\ntions \u201cin the manner provided by law\u201d for all other motions\nis simply a command to apply the usual federal procedural\nrules, including any rules relating to a motion\u2019s timeliness.\nOr put conversely, it is a bar on using custom-made rules,\nto tilt the playing field in favor of (or against) arbitration.\nAs explained above, the usual federal rule of waiver does\nnot include a prejudice requirement. So Section 6 instructs\nthat prejudice is not a condition of finding that a party, by\nlitigating too long, waived its right to stay litigation or com-\npel arbitration under the FAA.\n   Stripped of its prejudice requirement, the Eighth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s current waiver inquiry would focus on Sundance\u2019s\nconduct. Did Sundance, as the rest of the Eighth Circuit\u2019s\ntest asks, knowingly relinquish the right to arbitrate by act-\ning inconsistently with that right? See supra, at 3. On re-\nmand, the Court of Appeals may resolve that question, or\n(as indicated above) determine that a different procedural\nframework (such as forfeiture) is appropriate. See supra,\nat 4. Our sole holding today is that it may not make up a\nnew procedural rule based on the FAA\u2019s \u201cpolicy favoring ar-\nbitration.\u201d\n                        *     *    *\n  For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed-\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2021                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

When applying for the job,\n  Morgan signed an agreement to arbitrate any employment dispute.\n  Despite that agreement, Morgan filed a nationwide collective action\n  asserting that Sundance had violated federal law regarding overtime\n  payment. Sundance initially defended against the lawsuit as if no ar-\n  bitration agreement existed, filing a motion to dismiss (which the Dis-\n  trict Court denied) and engaging in mediation (which was unsuccess-\n  ful). Then\u2014nearly eight months after Morgan filed the lawsuit\u2014\n  Sundance moved to stay the litigation and compel arbitration under\n  the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Morgan opposed, arguing that\n  Sundance had waived its right to arbitrate by litigating for so long.\n     The courts below applied Eighth Circuit precedent, under which a\n  party waives its right to arbitration if it knew of the right; \u201cacted in-\n  consistently with that right\u201d; and \u201cprejudiced the other party by its\n  inconsistent actions.\u201d Erdman Co. v.

The federal policy is about treating arbitration\n    contracts like all others, not about fostering arbitration.\n       The text of the FAA makes clear that courts are not to create arbi-\n    tration-specific procedural rules like the one here. Section 6 of the FAA\n    provides that any application under the statute\u2014including an appli-\n    cation to stay litigation or compel arbitration\u2014\u201cshall be made and\n    heard in the manner provided by law for the making and hearing of\n    motions\u201d (unless the statute says otherwise). A directive to treat arbi-\n    tration applications \u201cin the manner provided by law\u201d for all other mo-\n    tions is simply a command to apply the usual federal procedural rules,\n    including any rules relating to a motion\u2019s timeliness. Because the\n    usual federal rule of waiver does not include a prejudice requirement,\n    Section 6 instructs that prejudice is not a condition of finding that a\n    party waived its right to stay litigation or compel arbitration under the\n    FAA.\n       Stripped of its prejudice requirement, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s current\n    waiver inquiry would focus on Sundance\u2019s conduct. Did Sundance\n    knowingly relinquish the right to arbitrate by acting inconsistently\n    with that right? On remand, the Court of Appeals may resolve that\n    question, or determine that a different procedural framework (such as\n    forfeiture) is appropriate. The Court\u2019s sole holding today is that it may\n    not make up a new procedural rule based on the FAA\u2019s \u201cpolicy favoring\n    arbitration.\u201d Pp. 4\u20137.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">992 F. 3d 711</span><pre class=\"inline\">, vacated and remanded.\n\n    KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n\f                        Cite as: 596 U.

See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">9 U. S. C. \u00a73</span><pre class=\"inline\">. But defendants do not always\nseek that relief right away. Sometimes, they engage in\nmonths, or even years, of litigation\u2014filing motions to dis-\nmiss, answering complaints, and discussing settlement\u2014\nbefore deciding they would fare better in arbitration. When\nthat happens, the court faces a question: Has the defend-\nant\u2019s request to switch to arbitration come too late?\n   Most Courts of Appeals have answered that question by\napplying a rule of waiver specific to the arbitration context.\nUsually, a federal court deciding whether a litigant has\nwaived a right does not ask if its actions caused harm. But\nwhen the right concerns arbitration, courts have held, a\nfinding of harm is essential: A party can waive its arbitra-\ntion right by litigating only when its conduct has prejudiced\nthe other side. That special rule, the courts say, derives\nfrom the FAA\u2019s \u201cpolicy favoring arbitration.\u201d\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether the FAA author-\n\f2                MORGAN v. SUNDANCE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nizes federal courts to create such an arbitration-specific pro-\ncedural rule. We hold it does not.\n                                I\n   Petitioner Robyn Morgan worked as an hourly employee\nat a Taco Bell franchise owned by respondent Sundance.\nWhen applying for the job, she signed an agreement to \u201cuse\nconfidential binding arbitration, instead of going to court,\u201d\nto resolve any employment dispute. App. 77.\n   Despite that agreement, Morgan brought a nationwide\ncollective action against Sundance in federal court for vio-\nlations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Under that stat-\nute, employers must pay overtime to covered employees\nwho work more than 40 hours in a week. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7207</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a). Morgan alleged that Sundance routinely flouted\nthe Act\u2014most notably, by recording hours worked in one\nweek as instead worked in another to prevent any week\u2019s\ntotal from exceeding 40. See App. 12.\n   Sundance initially defended itself against Morgan\u2019s suit\nas if no arbitration agreement existed. Sundance first\nmoved to dismiss the suit as duplicative of a collective ac-\ntion previously brought by other Taco Bell employees. In\nthat motion, Sundance suggested that Morgan either \u201cjoin\u201d\nthe earlier suit or \u201crefile her claim on an individual basis.\u201d\nId., at 39. But Morgan declined the invitation to litigate\ndifferently, and the District Court denied Sundance\u2019s mo-\ntion. Sundance then answered Morgan\u2019s complaint, assert-\ning 14 affirmative defenses\u2014but none mentioning the arbi-\ntration agreement. Soon afterward, Sundance met in a\njoint mediation with the named plaintiffs in both collective\nactions. The other suit settled, but Morgan\u2019s did not. She\nand Sundance began to talk about scheduling the rest of the\nlitigation.\n   And then\u2014nearly eight months after the suit\u2019s filing\u2014\nSundance changed course. It moved to stay the litigation\nand compel arbitration under Sections 3 and 4 of the FAA.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

The parties\nhave also quarreled about whether to understand that in-\nquiry as involving rules of waiver, forfeiture, estoppel,\nlaches, or procedural timeliness. We do not address those\nissues. The Courts of Appeals, including the Eighth Circuit,\nhave generally resolved cases like this one as a matter of\nfederal law, using the terminology of waiver. For today, we\nassume without deciding they are right to do so. We con-\nsider only the next step in their reasoning: that they may\ncreate arbitration-specific variants of federal procedural\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Joca-Roca Real Estate, LLC v.

For that reason, the Eighth Circuit was wrong to\ncondition a waiver of the right to arbitrate on a showing of\nprejudice.\n   Outside the arbitration context, a federal court assessing\nwaiver does not generally ask about prejudice.

To de-\ncide whether a waiver has occurred, the court focuses on the\nactions of the person who held the right; the court seldom\nconsiders the effects of those actions on the opposing party.\nThat analysis applies to the waiver of a contractual right,\nas of any other.

Section 6 of the FAA provides that\nany application under the statute\u2014including an applica-\ntion to stay litigation or compel arbitration\u2014\u201cshall be made\nand heard in the manner provided by law for the making\nand hearing of motions\u201d (unless the statute says otherwise).\nA directive to a federal court to treat arbitration applica-\ntions \u201cin the manner provided by law\u201d for all other motions\nis simply a command to apply the usual federal procedural\nrules, including any rules relating to a motion\u2019s timeliness.\nOr put conversely, it is a bar on using custom-made rules,\nto tilt the playing field in favor of (or against) arbitration.\nAs explained above, the usual federal rule of waiver does\nnot include a prejudice requirement. So Section 6 instructs\nthat prejudice is not a condition of finding that a party, by\nlitigating too long, waived its right to stay litigation or com-\npel arbitration under the FAA.\n   Stripped of its prejudice requirement, the Eighth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s current waiver inquiry would focus on Sundance\u2019s\nconduct. Did Sundance, as the rest of the Eighth Circuit\u2019s\ntest asks, knowingly relinquish the right to arbitrate by act-\ning inconsistently with that right? See supra, at 3. On re-\nmand, the Court of Appeals may resolve that question, or\n(as indicated above) determine that a different procedural\nframework (such as forfeiture) is appropriate. See supra,\nat 4.

Argued December 8, 2021\u2014Decided May 23, 2022*\nRespondents David Martinez Ramirez and Barry Lee Jones were each\n  convicted of capital crimes in Arizona state court and sentenced to\n  death. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed each case on direct re-\n  view, and each prisoner was denied state postconviction relief. Each\n  also filed for federal habeas relief under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254, arguing\n  that trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to conduct adequate\n  investigations. The Federal District Court held in each case that the\n  prisoner\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim was procedurally defaulted be-\n  cause it was not properly presented in state court. To overcome proce-\n  dural default in such cases, a prisoner must demonstrate \u201ccause\u201d to\n  excuse the procedural defect and \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d Coleman v.\n  Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750. To demonstrate cause, Ramirez and\n  Jones relied on Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. 1, which held that ineffec-\n  tive assistance of postconviction counsel may be cited as cause for the\n  procedural default of an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.\n  In Ramirez\u2019s case, the District Court permitted him to supplement the\n  record with evidence not presented in state court to support his case to\n  excuse the procedural default. Assessing the new evidence, the court\n  excused the procedural default but rejected Ramirez\u2019s ineffective-as-\n  sistance claim on the merits. The Ninth Circuit reversed and re-\n  manded for more evidentiary development to litigate the merits of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with Shinn, Director, Arizona Department of Corrections,\nRehabilitation and Reentry, et al. v.

In Jones\u2019 case,\n    the District Court held a lengthy evidentiary hearing on \u201ccause\u201d and\n    \u201cprejudice,\u201d forgave his procedural default, and held that his state trial\n    counsel had provided ineffective assistance. The State of Arizona pe-\n    titioned this Court in both cases, arguing that \u00a72254(e)(2) does not per-\n    mit a federal court to order evidentiary development simply because\n    postconviction counsel is alleged to have negligently failed to develop\n    the state-court record.\nHeld: Under \u00a72254(e)(2), a federal habeas court may not conduct an evi-\n dentiary hearing or otherwise consider evidence beyond the state-court\n record based on the ineffective assistance of state postconviction coun-\n sel. Pp. 6\u201322.\n    (a) To respect federal-state dual sovereignty, see Printz v. United\n States, 521 U. S. 898, 918, the availability of federal habeas relief is\n narrowly circumscribed, see Brown v. Davenport, 596 U. S. ___, ___\u2013\n ___. For example, only rarely may a federal habeas court hear a claim\n or consider evidence that a prisoner did not previously present to the\n state courts in compliance with state procedural rules. Pp. 6\u201313.\n      (1) Federal habeas review overrides the States\u2019 core power to en-\n force criminal law\u2014an intrusion that \u201cimposes special costs\u201d on the\n federal system. Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 128. Two of those costs\n are particularly relevant here. First, a federal order to retry or release\n a state prisoner overrides the State\u2019s sovereign power to enforce \u201csoci-\n etal norms through criminal law.\u201d Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S.\n 538, 556. Second, federal intervention imposes significant costs on\n state criminal justice systems. See, e.g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433\n U. S. 72, 90. Pp. 6\u20138.\n      (2) In light of these costs, this Court recognizes that federal ha-\n beas review is not \u201ca substitute for ordinary error correction through\n appeal,\u201d but is an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d that guards only against\n \u201cextreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems.\u201d Harring-\n ton v. Richter, 562 U. S. 86, 102\u2013103. To ensure that federal habeas\n retains its narrow role, both Congress and federal habeas courts have\n set out strict rules requiring prisoners to raise all of their federal\n claims in state court before seeking federal relief. The Antiterrorism\n and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) requires state pris-\n oners to \u201cexhaus[t] the remedies available in the courts of the State\u201d\n before seeking federal habeas relief. \u00a72254(b)(1)(A).

S., at 750. Pp. 8\u201310.\n     (3) Nonetheless, a federal court is not required to automatically\ndeny unexhausted or procedurally defaulted claims. For instance,\nwhen a claim is procedurally defaulted, a federal court can forgive the\ndefault and adjudicate the claim if the prisoner provides an adequate\nexcuse. And if the state-court record for that defaulted claim is unde-\nveloped, the prisoner must show that factual development in federal\ncourt is appropriate. Pp. 10\u201313.\n        (i) Federal courts may excuse procedural default only if a pris-\noner \u201ccan demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a\nresult of the alleged violation of federal law.\u201d Coleman, 501 U.

With respect to cause, \u201cattorney error cannot provide cause to\nexcuse a default\u201d \u201cin proceedings for which the Constitution does not\nguarantee the assistance of counsel at all.\u201d Davila, 582 U. S., at ___.\nBut in Martinez, this Court recognized a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to that\nrule, holding that ineffective assistance of state postconviction counsel\nmay constitute \u201ccause\u201d to forgive procedural default of a trial-ineffec-\ntive-assistance claim, but only if the State requires prisoners to raise\nsuch claims for the first time during state collateral proceedings. 566\nU. S., at 9. Pp. 10\u201311.\n        (ii) Excusing a prisoner\u2019s failure to develop the state-court rec-\nord faces an even higher bar. Section 2254(e)(2) applies when a pris-\noner \u201chas failed to develop the factual basis of a claim,\u201d i.e., is \u201cat fault\u201d\nfor the undeveloped record in state court, Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.\n420, 432. If a prisoner is \u201cat fault,\u201d a federal court may hold \u201can evi-\ndentiary hearing on the claim\u201d in only two limited scenarios not rele-\nvant here. See \u00a7\u00a72254(e)(2)(A)(i), (ii). The prisoner also must show\nthat further factfinding would demonstrate, by clear and convincing\nevidence, that he is innocent of the crime charged. Pp. 12\u201313.\n   (b) Although respondents do not satisfy \u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s narrow excep-\ntions, the Court of Appeals forgave respondents\u2019 failures to develop the\nstate-court record because, in its view, they each received ineffective\nassistance of state postconviction counsel. The Court of Appeals erred.\nPp. 13\u201322.\n     (1) Respondents primarily argue that a prisoner is not \u201cat fault\u201d\nfor the undeveloped record if state postconviction counsel negligently\nfailed to develop the state record for a claim of ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel. But under AEDPA and this Court\u2019s precedents, state\npostconviction counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance in developing the state-\ncourt record is attributed to the prisoner.

MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n            (i) A prisoner \u201cbears the risk in federal habeas for all attorney\n    errors made in the course of the representation.\u201d Coleman, 501 U. S.,\n    at 754. And, because there is no constitutional right to counsel in state\n    postconviction proceedings, a prisoner must ordinarily \u201cbea[r] respon-\n    sibility\u201d for all attorney errors during those proceedings, Williams, 529\n    U. S., at 432, including responsibility for counsel\u2019s negligent failure to\n    develop the state postconviction record. This Court\u2019s prior cases make\n    this point clear. See, e.g., Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1; Wil-\n    liams, 529 U. S. 420; Holland v. Jackson, 542 U. S. 649 (per curiam).\n    Thus, a prisoner is \u201cat fault\u201d even when state postconviction counsel is\n    negligent. Pp. 14\u201315.\n            (ii) Respondents propose extending Martinez so that ineffective\n    assistance of postconviction counsel can excuse a prisoner\u2019s failure to\n    develop the state-court record under \u00a72254(e)(2). But unlike judge-\n    made exceptions to procedural default, \u00a72254(e)(2) is a statute, and\n    thus, this Court has no power to redefine when a prisoner \u201chas failed\n    to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings.\u201d Nor\n    is it plausible, as respondents contend, that Congress might have en-\n    acted \u00a72254(e)(2) with the expectation that this Court would one day\n    open the door to allowing the ineffective assistance of state postconvic-\n    tion counsel to be cause to forgive procedural default. Finally, Mar-\n    tinez itself cuts against respondents\u2019 proposed result. Martinez fore-\n    closed any extension of its holding beyond the \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to\n    procedural default at issue in that case. See 566 U. S., at 9. That\n    assurance has bite only if the State can rely on the state-court record.\n    The cases here demonstrate the improper burden imposed on the\n    States when Martinez applies beyond its narrow scope, with the\n    sprawling evidentiary hearing in Jones\u2019 case being particularly poign-\n    ant. Pp. 15\u201319.\n          (2) Respondents propose a second reading of \u00a72254(e)(2) that sup-\n    posedly permits consideration of new evidence in their habeas cases.\n    First, they argue that because \u00a72254(e)(2) bars only \u201can evidentiary\n    hearing on the claim,\u201d a federal court may hold an evidentiary hearing\n    to determine whether there is cause and prejudice. Second, respond-\n    ents contend that the habeas court may then consider that new evi-\n    dence to evaluate the merits of the underlying ineffective-assistance\n    claim. By considering already admitted evidence, respondents reason,\n    the habeas court is not holding a \u201chearing\u201d prohibited by \u00a72254(e)(2).\n    But, in Holland, this Court explained that \u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s \u201crestrictions\n    apply a fortiori when a prisoner seeks relief based on new evidence\n    without an evidentiary hearing.\u201d 542 U. S., at 653 (emphasis deleted).\n    Therefore, when a federal habeas court convenes an evidentiary hear-\n    ing for any purpose, or otherwise reviews any evidence for any pur-\n    pose, it may not consider that evidence on the merits of a negligent\n\f                      Cite as: 596 U.

Coleman v. Thompson, 501\nU. S. 722, 750 (1991). In Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. 1\n(2012), this Court explained that ineffective assistance of\npostconviction counsel is \u201ccause\u201d to forgive procedural de-\nfault of an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, but\nonly if the State required the prisoner to raise that claim\n\f2               SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor the first time during state postconviction proceedings.\n  Often, a prisoner with a defaulted claim will ask a federal\nhabeas court not only to consider his claim but also to per-\nmit him to introduce new evidence to support it. Under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), the standard to expand the state-court record is\na stringent one. If a prisoner has \u201cfailed to develop the fac-\ntual basis of a claim in State court proceedings,\u201d a federal\ncourt \u201cshall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim\u201d\nunless the prisoner satisfies one of two narrow exceptions,\nsee 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(e)(2)(A), and demonstrates that the\nnew evidence will establish his innocence \u201cby clear and con-\nvincing evidence,\u201d \u00a72254(e)(2)(B). In all but these extraor-\ndinary cases, AEDPA \u201cbars evidentiary hearings in federal\nhabeas proceedings initiated by state prisoners.\u201d McQuig-\ngin v. Perkins, 569 U. S. 383, 395 (2013).\n  The question presented is whether the equitable rule an-\nnounced in Martinez permits a federal court to dispense\nwith \u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s narrow limits because a prisoner\u2019s state\npostconviction counsel negligently failed to develop the\nstate-court record. We conclude that it does not.\n                             I\n  In this case, we address two petitions brought by the\nState of Arizona. See Ramirez v. Ryan, 937 F. 3d 1230 (CA9\n2019); Jones v. Shinn, 943 F. 3d 1211 (CA9 2019).\n                               A\n   On May 25, 1989, David Ramirez fatally stabbed his girl-\nfriend, Mary Ann Gortarez, and her 15-year-old daughter,\nCandie, in their home. 937 F. 3d, at 1234\u20131235; State v.\nRamirez, 178 Ariz. 116, 119, 121, 871 P. 2d 237, 240, 242\n(1994). Ramirez stabbed Mary Ann 18 times in the neck\nwith a pair of scissors, and Candie 15 times in the neck with\na box cutter. Id., at 121, 871 P. 2d, at 242. Police also found\nphysical evidence that Ramirez had raped Candie, and\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nRamirez later admitted that he had sex with the child on\nthe night of the murders and four times before. Ibid. A jury\nconvicted Ramirez of two counts of premeditated first-\ndegree murder. Ibid. The trial court sentenced Ramirez to\ndeath, ibid., and the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed on\ndirect review, id., at 132, 871 P. 2d, at 253.\n   Ramirez then filed his first petition for state postconvic-\ntion relief. That petition raised myriad claims, but it did\nnot raise the one at issue here: that Ramirez\u2019s trial counsel\nprovided ineffective assistance for \u201cfailing to conduct a com-\nplete mitigation investigation\u201d or \u201cobtai[n] and present\navailable mitigation evidence at sentencing.\u201d App. 402.\nRamirez did not raise this ineffective-assistance claim until\nhe subsequently filed a successive state habeas petition,\nwhich the state court summarily denied as untimely under\nArizona law. See ibid.\n   Ramirez also petitioned the U. S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Arizona for a writ of habeas corpus under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254. As relevant here, the District Court held\nthat Ramirez had procedurally defaulted his ineffective-\nassistance claim by failing to raise it before the Arizona\ncourts in a timely fashion. See App. 402\u2013403. Ramirez re-\nsponded that the District Court should forgive the proce-\ndural default because his state postconviction counsel was\nhimself ineffective for failing to raise the trial-ineffective-\nassistance claim and develop the facts to support it.\n   The District Court permitted Ramirez to file several dec-\nlarations and other evidence not presented to the state\ncourt to support his request to excuse his procedural de-\nfault. See 937 F. 3d, at 1238. Assessing the new evidence,\nthe District Court excused the procedural default but re-\njected Ramirez\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim on the merits.\nSee id., at 1240.\n   The Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded. Like the Dis-\ntrict Court, it held that Ramirez\u2019s state postconviction coun-\n\f4               SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsel\u2019s failure to raise and develop the trial-ineffective-assis-\ntance claim was cause to forgive the procedural default. See\nid., at 1247\u20131248. The Ninth Circuit also held that\nRamirez\u2019s underlying trial-ineffective-assistance claim was\nsubstantial, and that Ramirez therefore had suffered prej-\nudice. See id., at 1243\u20131247. But, unlike the District\nCourt, the Court of Appeals declined to decide the merits of\nRamirez\u2019s claim. The court remanded the case for further\nfactfinding because, in its view, Ramirez was \u201centitled to\nevidentiary development to litigate the merits of his inef-\nfective assistance of trial counsel claim.\u201d Id., at 1248.\n  Arizona petitioned for rehearing en banc, arguing that\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s remand for additional evidentiary de-\nvelopment violated 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(e)(2). The Ninth Cir-\ncuit denied rehearing over an eight-judge dissent by Judge\nCollins. See 971 F. 3d 1116 (2020).\n                                B\n   On May 1, 1994, Barry Lee Jones repeatedly beat his girl-\nfriend\u2019s 4-year-old daughter, Rachel Gray. See 943 F. 3d,\nat 1215\u20131216; State v. Jones, 188 Ariz. 388, 391, 937 P. 2d\n310, 313 (1997). One blow to Rachel\u2019s abdomen ruptured\nher small intestine. See id., at 391, 937 P. 2d, at 313. She\nalso sustained several injuries to her vagina and labia con-\nsistent with sexual assault. Ibid. Early the next morning,\nJones drove Rachel to the hospital, where she was pro-\nnounced dead on arrival. See ibid. Rachel died of peritoni-\ntis\u2014\u201can infection of the lining of the abdomen caused by a\nruptured intestine.\u201d Ibid. A jury convicted Jones of sexual\nassault, three counts of child abuse, and felony murder.\nIbid. The trial judge sentenced Jones to death, ibid., and\nthe Arizona Supreme Court affirmed on direct review, see\nid., at 401, 937 P. 2d, at 323.\n   Jones then petitioned for state postconviction relief. He\nalleged ineffective assistance by his trial counsel, but not\nthe specific trial-ineffective-assistance claim at issue here:\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat his counsel \u201cfail[ed] to conduct sufficient trial investi-\ngation.\u201d 943 F. 3d, at 1218. The Arizona Supreme Court\nsummarily denied relief. See ibid.\n  Jones next filed a habeas petition in the U. S. District\nCourt for the District of Arizona. The District Court held\nthat Jones\u2019 trial-ineffective-assistance claim was procedur-\nally defaulted, so Jones, like Ramirez, invoked his postcon-\nviction counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance as grounds to forgive\nthe default. Ibid. To bolster his case for cause and preju-\ndice, Jones also moved to supplement the undeveloped\nstate-court record. Ibid. The District Court held a 7-day\nevidentiary hearing with more than 10 witnesses and ulti-\nmately decided to forgive Jones\u2019 procedural default. See id.,\nat 1219, 1225\u20131226. The court then relied on the new evi-\ndence from the cause-and-prejudice hearing to hold, on the\nmerits, that Jones\u2019 trial counsel had provided ineffective as-\nsistance. See id., at 1219.\n  Arizona appealed, arguing that \u00a72254(e)(2) did not per-\nmit the evidentiary hearing. The Ninth Circuit affirmed,\nholding that \u00a72254(e)(2) did not apply because Jones\u2019 state\npostconviction counsel was ineffective for failing to develop\nthe state-court record for Jones\u2019 trial-ineffective-assistance\nclaim. See id., at 1220\u20131222.\n  As in Ramirez, Arizona petitioned for rehearing en banc.\nAnd, also as in Ramirez, the Ninth Circuit denied Arizona\u2019s\npetition over the dissent of Judge Collins, joined by seven\nother judges. Jones v. Shinn, 971 F. 3d 1133 (2020).\n                              C\n  As noted above, Arizona petitioned for a writ of certiorari\nin both Ramirez and Jones. The State maintains that 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(e)(2) does not permit a federal court to order\nevidentiary development simply because postconviction\ncounsel is alleged to have negligently failed to develop the\nstate-court record.

S., at 102\u2013103. The writ of habeas corpus is an \u201cextraor-\ndinary remedy\u201d that guards only against \u201cextreme malfunc-\ntions in the state criminal justice systems.\u201d Id., at 102 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted); see also Brecht v.\nAbrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 633\u2013634 (1993). To ensure\nthat federal habeas corpus retains its narrow role, AEDPA\nimposes several limits on habeas relief, and we have pre-\nscribed several more. See, e.g., Brown, 596 U. S., at ___\u2013\n___ (slip op., at 11\u201313). And even if a prisoner overcomes\nall of these limits, he is never entitled to habeas relief. He\nmust still \u201cpersuade a federal habeas court that law and\njustice require [it].\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted).\n   As relevant here, both Congress and federal habeas\ncourts have set out strict rules requiring prisoners to raise\nall of their federal claims in state court before seeking fed-\neral relief. First, AEDPA requires state prisoners to \u201cex-\nhaus[t] the remedies available in the courts of the State\u201d\nbefore seeking federal habeas relief.                  28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(b)(1)(A). Ordinarily, a state prisoner satisfies this\nexhaustion requirement by raising his federal claim before\nthe state courts in accordance with state procedures. See\nO\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 848 (1999). If he does\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nso, a federal habeas court may hear his claim, but its review\nis highly circumscribed. In particular, the federal court\nmay review the claim based solely on the state-court record,\nsee Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. 170, 180 (2011), and the\nprisoner must demonstrate that, under this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents, no \u201cfairminded juris[t]\u201d could have reached the same\njudgment as the state court, Harrington, 562 U. S., at 102;\nsee \u00a72254(d).\n   State prisoners, however, often fail to raise their federal\nclaims in compliance with state procedures, or even raise\nthose claims in state court at all. If a state court would dis-\nmiss these claims for their procedural failures, such claims\nare technically exhausted because, in the habeas context,\n\u201cstate-court remedies are . . . \u2018exhausted\u2019 when they are no\nlonger available, regardless of the reason for their unavail-\nability.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. 81, 92\u201393 (2006). But\nto allow a state prisoner simply to ignore state procedure\non the way to federal court would defeat the evident goal of\nthe exhaustion rule. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 732. Thus,\nfederal habeas courts must apply \u201can important \u2018corollary\u2019\nto the exhaustion requirement\u201d: the doctrine of procedural\ndefault. Davila, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). Under that\ndoctrine, federal courts generally decline to hear any fed-\neral claim that was not presented to the state courts \u201ccon-\nsistent with [the State\u2019s] own procedural rules.\u201d Edwards\nv. Carpenter, 529 U. S. 446, 453 (2000).\n   Together, exhaustion and procedural default promote\nfederal-state comity. Exhaustion affords States \u201can initial\nopportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of\nprisoners\u2019 federal rights,\u201d Duckworth v. Serrano, 454 U. S.\n1, 3 (1981) (per curiam), and procedural default protects\nagainst \u201cthe significant harm to the States that results from\nthe failure of federal courts to respect\u201d state procedural\nrules, Coleman, 501 U. S., at 750. Ultimately, \u201cit would be\nunseemly in our dual system of government for a federal\n\f10               SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ndistrict court to upset a state court conviction without [giv-\ning] an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitu-\ntional violation,\u201d Darr v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204 (1950),\nand to do so consistent with their own procedures, see Ed-\nwards, 529 U. S., at 452\u2013453.\n                               C\n  Despite the many benefits of exhaustion and procedural\ndefault, and the substantial costs when those doctrines are\nnot enforced, we have held that a federal court is not re-\nquired to automatically deny unexhausted or procedurally\ndefaulted claims. When a claim is unexhausted, the pris-\noner might have an opportunity to return to state court to\nadjudicate the claim. See, e.g., Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S.\n509, 520 (1982). When a claim is procedurally defaulted, a\nfederal court can forgive the default and adjudicate the\nclaim if the prisoner provides an adequate excuse. Like-\nwise, if the state-court record for that defaulted claim is un-\ndeveloped, the prisoner must show that factual develop-\nment in federal court is appropriate.\n                                 1\n  \u201cOut of respect for finality, comity, and the orderly ad-\nministration of justice,\u201d Dretke v. Haley, 541 U. S. 386, 388\n(2004), federal courts may excuse procedural default only if\na prisoner \u201ccan demonstrate cause for the default and ac-\ntual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal\nlaw,\u201d Coleman, 501 U. S., at 750. To establish cause, the\nprisoner must \u201cshow that some objective factor external to\nthe defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the\nState\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478,\n488 (1986). Then, to establish prejudice, the prisoner must\nshow not merely a substantial federal claim, such that \u201c \u2018the\nerrors at . . . trial created a possibility of prejudice,\u201d but ra-\nther that the constitutional violation \u201cworked to his actual\nand substantial disadvantage.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 494 (quoting United\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

S. 152, 170 (1982)).\n   With respect to cause, \u201c[a]ttorney ignorance or inadvert-\nence\u201d cannot excuse procedural default. Coleman, 501\nU. S., at 753. \u201c[T]he attorney is the petitioner\u2019s agent when\nacting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and\nthe petitioner must bear the risk of attorney error.\u201d Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). That said, \u201cif the pro-\ncedural default is the result of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, the Sixth Amendment itself requires that respon-\nsibility for the default be imputed to the State.\u201d Murray,\n477 U. S., at 488. That is not because a constitutional error\n\u201cis so bad that the lawyer ceases to be an agent\u201d of the pris-\noner, but rather because a violation of the right to counsel\n\u201cmust be seen as an external factor\u201d to the prisoner\u2019s de-\nfense. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 754 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). \u201cIt follows, then, that in proceedings for which\nthe Constitution does not guarantee the assistance of coun-\nsel at all, attorney error cannot provide cause to excuse a\ndefault.\u201d Davila, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).\n   In Martinez, this Court recognized a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d\nto the rule that attorney error cannot establish cause to ex-\ncuse a procedural default unless it violates the Constitu-\ntion. 566 U. S., at 9. There, the Court held that ineffective\nassistance of state postconviction counsel may constitute\n\u201ccause\u201d to forgive procedural default of a trial-ineffective-\nassistance claim, but only if the State requires prisoners to\nraise such claims for the first time during state collateral\nproceedings. See ibid. One year later, in Trevino v. Thaler,\n569 U. S. 413 (2013), this Court held that this \u201cnarrow ex-\nception\u201d applies if the State\u2019s judicial system effectively\nforecloses direct review of trial-ineffective-assistance\nclaims. Id., at 428. Otherwise, attorney error where there\nis no right to counsel remains insufficient to show cause.\nMartinez, 566 U. S., at 16.\n\f12              SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               2\n   There is an even higher bar for excusing a prisoner\u2019s fail-\nure to develop the state-court record. Shortly before\nAEDPA, we held that a prisoner who \u201cnegligently failed\u201d to\ndevelop the state-court record must satisfy Coleman\u2019s\ncause-and-prejudice standard before a federal court can\nhold an evidentiary hearing. Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504\nU. S. 1, 9 (1992). In Keeney, we explained that \u201clittle [could]\nbe said for holding a habeas petitioner to one standard for\nfailing to bring a claim in state court and excusing the peti-\ntioner under another, lower standard for failing to develop\nthe factual basis of that claim in the same forum.\u201d Id., at\n10. And, consistent with Coleman, we held that evidentiary\ndevelopment would be inappropriate \u201cwhere the cause as-\nserted is attorney error.\u201d 504 U. S., at 11, n. 5.\n   Four years later, Congress enacted AEDPA and replaced\nKeeney\u2019s cause-and-prejudice standard for evidentiary de-\nvelopment with the even \u201cmore stringent requirements\u201d\nnow codified at 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(e)(2). Williams v. Taylor,\n529 U. S. 420, 433 (2000) (Michael Williams). Section\n2254(e)(2) provides that, if a prisoner \u201chas failed to develop\nthe factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings,\u201d a\nfederal court may hold \u201can evidentiary hearing on the\nclaim\u201d in only two limited scenarios. Either the claim must\nrely on (1) a \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cpreviously unavailable\u201d \u201crule of\nconstitutional law\u201d made retroactively applicable by this\nCourt, or (2) \u201ca factual predicate that could not have been\npreviously discovered through the exercise of due dili-\ngence.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72254(e)(2)(A)(i), (ii). If a prisoner can satisfy ei-\nther of these exceptions, he also must show that further\nfactfinding would demonstrate, \u201cby clear and convincing ev-\nidence,\u201d that \u201cno reasonable factfinder\u201d would have con-\nvicted him of the crime charged. \u00a72254(e)(2)(B). Finally,\neven if all of these requirements are satisfied, a federal ha-\nbeas court still is not required to hold a hearing or take any\nevidence. Like the decision to grant habeas relief itself, the\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

Cf. Brown, 596 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 13\u2013\n14).\n  Even though AEDPA largely displaced Keeney,\n\u00a72254(e)(2) retained \u201cone aspect of Keeney\u2019s holding.\u201d Mi-\nchael Williams, 529 U. S., at 433. Namely, \u00a72254(e)(2) ap-\nplies only when a prisoner \u201chas failed to develop the factual\nbasis of a claim.\u201d We interpret \u201cfail,\u201d consistent with\nKeeney, to mean that the prisoner must be \u201cat fault\u201d for the\nundeveloped record in state court. 529 U. S., at 432. A pris-\noner is \u201cat fault\u201d if he \u201cbears responsibility for the failure\u201d\nto develop the record. Ibid.\n                              III\n   Respondents concede that they do not satisfy\n\u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s narrow exceptions. Nonetheless, the Court of\nAppeals forgave respondents\u2019 failures to develop the state-\ncourt record because, in its view, they each received ineffec-\ntive assistance of state postconviction counsel. We now hold\nthat, under \u00a72254(e)(2), a federal habeas court may not con-\nduct an evidentiary hearing or otherwise consider evidence\nbeyond the state-court record based on ineffective assis-\ntance of state postconviction counsel.\n                              A\n  Respondents\u2019 primary claim is that a prisoner is not \u201cat\nfault,\u201d Michael Williams, 529 U. S., at 432, and therefore\nhas not \u201cfailed to develop the factual basis of a claim in\nState court proceedings,\u201d \u00a72254(e)(2), if state postconviction\ncounsel negligently failed to develop the state record for a\nclaim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. But under\nAEDPA and our precedents, state postconviction counsel\u2019s\nineffective assistance in developing the state-court record is\nattributed to the prisoner.\n\f14              SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                                1\n  As stated above, a prisoner \u201cbears the risk in federal ha-\nbeas for all attorney errors made in the course of the repre-\nsentation,\u201d Coleman, 501 U. S., at 754, unless counsel pro-\nvides \u201cconstitutionally ineffective\u201d assistance, Murray, 477\nU. S., at 488. And, because there is no constitutional right\nto counsel in state postconviction proceedings, see Davila,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6), a prisoner ordinarily must\n\u201cbea[r] responsibility\u201d for all attorney errors during those\nproceedings, Michael Williams, 529 U. S., at 432. Among\nthose errors, a state prisoner is responsible for counsel\u2019s\nnegligent failure to develop the state postconviction record.\n  Both before and after AEDPA, our prior cases have made\nthis point clear. First, in Keeney, \u201cmaterial facts had not\nbeen adequately developed in the state postconviction\ncourt, apparently due to the negligence of postconviction\ncounsel.\u201d 504 U. S., at 4 (citation omitted). We required the\nprisoner to demonstrate cause and prejudice to forgive post-\nconviction counsel\u2019s deficient performance, see id., at 11,\nand recognized that counsel\u2019s negligence, on its own, was\nnot a sufficient cause, see id., at 10, n. 5.\n  Second, in Michael Williams, we confirmed that \u201cthe\nopening clause of \u00a72254(e)(2) codifies Keeney\u2019s threshold\nstandard of diligence, so that prisoners who would have had\nto satisfy Keeney\u2019s [cause-and-prejudice] test . . . are now\ncontrolled by \u00a72254(e)(2).\u201d 529 U. S., at 434. In other\nwords, because Keeney held a prisoner responsible for state\npostconviction counsel\u2019s negligent failure to develop the\nstate-court record, the same rule applied under \u00a72254(e)(2).\nFor that reason, \u201ca failure to develop the factual basis of a\nclaim,\u201d as \u00a72254(e)(2) requires, \u201cis not established unless\nthere is lack of diligence, or some greater fault, attributable\nto the prisoner or the prisoner\u2019s counsel.\u201d 529 U. S., at 432\n(emphasis added). We then applied that rule and held that\nstate postconviction counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to investigate . . . in\nanything but a cursory manner trigger[ed] the opening\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

S. 649 (2004) (per\ncuriam), we again held a prisoner responsible for state post-\nconviction counsel\u2019s negligent failure to develop the state-\ncourt record. Seven years after the prisoner\u2019s conviction,\nand after he had already been denied state postconviction\nrelief, the prisoner found a new witness to provide impeach-\nment testimony. See id., at 650\u2013651. The prisoner claimed\nthat he discovered the witness so late because \u201cstate post-\nconviction counsel did not heed his pleas for assistance.\u201d\nId., at 653. Citing Coleman and Michael Williams, we re-\njected the prisoner\u2019s claim. \u201cAttorney negligence,\u201d we held,\n\u201cis chargeable to the client and precludes relief unless the\nconditions of \u00a72254(e)(2) are satisfied.\u201d 542 U. S., at 653.\n   In sum, under \u00a72254(e)(2), a prisoner is \u201cat fault\u201d even\nwhen state postconviction counsel is negligent. In such a\ncase, a federal court may order an evidentiary hearing or\notherwise expand the state-court record only if the prisoner\ncan satisfy \u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s stringent requirements.\n                               2\n   Respondents dispute none of this. Instead, they rely al-\nmost exclusively on Martinez\u2019s holding that ineffective as-\nsistance of postconviction counsel can be \u201ccause\u201d to forgive\nprocedural default of a trial-ineffective-assistance claim if a\nState forecloses direct review of that claim, as Arizona con-\ncededly does. See 566 U. S., at 9. Respondents contend that\nwhere, per Martinez, a prisoner is not responsible for state\npostconviction counsel\u2019s failure to raise a claim, it makes\nlittle sense to hold the prisoner responsible for the failure\nto develop that claim. Thus, respondents propose extending\nMartinez so that ineffective assistance of postconviction\ncounsel can excuse a prisoner\u2019s failure to develop the state-\ncourt record under \u00a72254(e)(2).\n   Congress foreclosed respondents\u2019 proposed expansion of\nMartinez when it passed AEDPA. Martinez decided that,\n\f16              SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin the exercise of our \u201cequitable judgment\u201d and \u201cdiscretion,\u201d\nit was appropriate to modify \u201c[t]he rules for when a prisoner\nmay establish cause to excuse a procedural default.\u201d Id., at\n13. Such \u201cexceptions\u201d to procedural default \u201care judge-\nmade rules\u201d that we may modify \u201conly when necessary.\u201d\nDretke, 541 U. S., at 394. Here, however, \u00a72254(e)(2) is a\nstatute that we have no authority to amend. \u201cWhere Con-\ngress has erected a constitutionally valid barrier to habeas\nrelief, a court cannot decline to give it effect.\u201d McQuiggin,\n569 U. S., at 402 (Scalia, J., dissenting); see also Ex parte\nBollman, 4 Cranch 75, 94 (1807) (Marshall, C. J., for the\nCourt). For example, in McQuiggin, we explained that we\nhave no power to layer a miscarriage-of-justice or actual-\ninnocence exception on top of the narrow limitations al-\nready included in \u00a72254(e)(2). See 569 U. S., at 395\u2013396\n(majority opinion).\n   The same follows here. We have no power to redefine\nwhen a prisoner \u201chas failed to develop the factual basis of a\nclaim in State court proceedings.\u201d \u00a72254(e)(2). Before\nAEDPA, Keeney held that \u201cattorney error\u201d during state\npostconviction proceedings was not cause to excuse an un-\ndeveloped state-court record. 504 U. S., at 11, n. 5. And, in\nMichael Williams, we acknowledged that \u00a72254(e)(2)\n\u201craised the bar Keeney imposed on prisoners who were not\ndiligent in state-court proceedings,\u201d 529 U. S., at 433, while\nreaffirming that prisoners are responsible for attorney er-\nror, see id., at 432. Yet here, respondents claim that attor-\nney error alone permits a federal court to expand the fed-\neral habeas record. That result makes factfinding more\nreadily available than Keeney envisioned pre-AEDPA and\nignores Michael Williams\u2019 admonition that \u201c[c]ounsel\u2019s fail-\nure\u201d to perform as a \u201cdiligent attorney\u201d \u201ctriggers the open-\ning clause of \u00a72254(e)(2).\u201d 529 U.

We simply\ncannot square respondents\u2019 proposed result with AEDPA or\nour precedents.\n   Respondents propose that Congress may have actually\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

According to respondents,\nMartinez explained that Coleman left open whether ineffec-\ntive assistance of state postconviction counsel might one\nday be cause to forgive procedural default, at least in an\n\u201cinitial-review collateral proceeding,\u201d Martinez, 566 U. S.,\nat 5, \u201cwhere state collateral review is the first place a pris-\noner can present a challenge to his conviction,\u201d Coleman,\n501 U. S., at 755. Respondents contend that Congress\nmight have enacted \u00a72254(e)(2) with the expectation that\nthis Court one day would open that door.\n   We do not agree. First, \u201c[g]iven our frequent recognition\nthat AEDPA limited rather than expanded the availability\nof habeas relief . . . it is implausible that, without saying\nso,\u201d Fry v. Pliler, 551 U. S. 112, 119 (2007), Congress in-\ntended this Court to liberalize the availability of habeas re-\nlief generally, or access to federal factfinding specifically.\nSecond, in Coleman, we \u201creiterate[d] that counsel\u2019s ineffec-\ntiveness will constitute cause only if it is an independent\nconstitutional violation,\u201d and surmised that a hypothetical\nconstitutional right to initial-review postconviction counsel\ncould give rise to a corresponding claim for cause. 501 U. S.,\nat 755; see also Martinez, 566 U. S., at 8\u20139. Since then,\nhowever, we have repeatedly reaffirmed that there is no\nconstitutional right to counsel in state postconviction pro-\nceedings. See, e.g., Davila, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).\n   We also reject respondents\u2019 equitable rewrite of\n\u00a72254(e)(2) because it lacks any principled limit. This\nCourt\u2019s holding in Martinez addressed only one kind of\nclaim: ineffective assistance of trial counsel. See 566 U. S.,\nat 9. We limited our holding in that way to reflect our \u201ceq-\nuitable judgment\u201d that trial-ineffective-assistance claims\nare uniquely important. Id., at 12\u201313. Respondents pro-\npose that we similarly should permit factual development\nunder \u00a72254(e)(2) only for trial-ineffective-assistance\nclaims. But \u00a72254(e)(2) applies whenever any state pris-\noner \u201cfailed to develop the factual basis of a claim,\u201d\n\f18              SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a72254(e)(2) (emphasis added), without limitation to any\nspecific claim. There would be no reason to limit respond-\nents\u2019 reconstruction of \u00a72254(e)(2) as they propose. Unlike\nfor procedural default, we lack equitable authority to\namend a statute to address only a subset of claims. Thus,\nif a prisoner were not \u201cat fault\u201d under \u00a72254(e)(2) simply\nbecause postconviction counsel provided ineffective assis-\ntance, Michael Williams, 529 U. S., at 432, the prisoner\u2019s\nblamelessness necessarily would extend to any claim that\npostconviction counsel negligently failed to develop. Not\neven Martinez sweeps that broadly.\n   Finally, setting aside that we lack authority to amend\n\u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s clear text, Martinez itself cuts against re-\nspondents\u2019 proposed result. Martinez was \u201cunusually ex-\nplicit about the narrowness of our decision.\u201d Trevino, 569\nU. S., at 431 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting). The Court left no\ndoubt that \u201c[t]he rule of Coleman governs in all but the lim-\nited circumstances recognized here.\u201d Martinez, 566 U. S.,\nat 16 (emphasis added). \u201cThis aggressively limiting lan-\nguage was not simply a customary nod to the truism that\nwe decide only the case before us.\u201d Trevino, 569 U. S., at\n432 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). \u201cIt was instead an important part\u201d of the Court\u2019s\nholding. Ibid. In short, Martinez foreclosed any extension\nof its holding beyond the \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to procedural\ndefault at issue in that case. 566 U. S., at 9.\n   To be sure, Martinez recognized that state prisoners often\nneed \u201cevidence outside the trial record\u201d to support their\ntrial-ineffective-assistance claims. Id., at 13. But Martinez\ndid not prescribe largely unbounded access to new evidence\nwhenever postconviction counsel is ineffective, as respond-\nents propose. Rather, Martinez recognized our overarching\nresponsibility \u201cto ensure that state-court judgments are ac-\ncorded the finality and respect necessary to preserve the in-\ntegrity of legal proceedings within our system of federal-\nism.\u201d Id., at 9. In particular, the Court explained that its\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cholding . . . ought not to put a significant strain on state\nresources,\u201d because a State \u201cfaced with the question\nwhether there is cause for an apparent default . . . may an-\nswer\u201d that the defaulted claim \u201cis wholly without factual\nsupport.\u201d Id., at 15\u201316. That assurance has bite only if the\nState can rely on the state-court record. Otherwise, \u201cfederal\nhabeas courts would routinely be required to hold eviden-\ntiary hearings to determine\u201d whether state postconviction\ncounsel\u2019s factfinding fell short. Murray, 477 U. S., at 487.\n   The cases under review demonstrate the improper bur-\nden imposed on the States when Martinez applies beyond\nits narrow scope. The sprawling evidentiary hearing in\nJones is particularly poignant. Ostensibly to assess cause\nand prejudice under Martinez, the District Court ordered a\n7-day hearing that included testimony from no fewer than\n10 witnesses, including defense trial counsel, defense post-\nconviction counsel, the lead investigating detective, three\nforensic pathologists, an emergency medicine and trauma\nspecialist, a biomechanics and functional human anatomy\nexpert, and a crime scene and bloodstain pattern analyst.\nSee 943 F. 3d, at 1219, 1225\u20131226. Of these witnesses, only\none of the forensic pathologists and the lead detective testi-\nfied at the original trial. See id., at 1223\u20131225. The re-\nmainder testified on virtually every disputed issue in the\ncase, including the timing of Rachel Gray\u2019s injuries and her\ncause of death. See id., at 1226\u20131228. This wholesale re-\nlitigation of Jones\u2019 guilt is plainly not what Martinez envi-\nsioned.\n                              B\n  Martinez aside, respondents propose a second reading of\n\u00a72254(e)(2) that supposedly permits consideration of new\nevidence in their habeas cases. Their interpretation pro-\nceeds in two steps. First, respondents argue that because\n\u00a72254(e)(2) bars only \u201can evidentiary hearing on the claim,\u201d\n\f20              SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na federal court may hold an evidentiary hearing to deter-\nmine whether there is cause and prejudice. In respondents\u2019\nview, a so-called \u201cMartinez hearing\u201d is not a \u201chearing on the\nclaim.\u201d \u00a72254(e)(2) (emphasis added). Second, with that\nevidence admitted for cause and prejudice, respondents\ncontend that the habeas court may then consider the new\nevidence to evaluate the merits of the underlying ineffective-\nassistance claim. By considering already admitted evi-\ndence, respondents reason, the habeas court is not holding\na \u201chearing\u201d that \u00a72254(e)(2) otherwise would prohibit. Ibid.\n   There are good reasons to doubt respondents\u2019 first point,\nbut we need not address it because our precedent squarely\nforecloses the second. In Holland, we explained that\n\u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s \u201crestrictions apply a fortiori when a prisoner\nseeks relief based on new evidence without an evidentiary\nhearing.\u201d 542 U. S., at 653 (emphasis deleted). The basis\nfor our decision was obvious: A contrary reading would have\ncountenanced an end-run around the statute. Federal ha-\nbeas courts could have accepted any new evidence so long\nas they avoided labeling their intake of the evidence as a\n\u201chearing.\u201d Therefore, when a federal habeas court convenes\nan evidentiary hearing for any purpose, or otherwise ad-\nmits or reviews new evidence for any purpose, it may not\nconsider that evidence on the merits of a negligent pris-\noner\u2019s defaulted claim unless the exceptions in \u00a72254(e)(2)\nare satisfied.\n   Respondents all but concede that their argument\namounts to the same kind of evasion of \u00a72254(e)(2) that we\nrejected in Holland. They nonetheless object that Holland\nrenders many Martinez hearings a nullity, because there is\nno point in developing a record for cause and prejudice if a\nfederal court cannot later consider that evidence on the\nmerits. While we agree that any such Martinez hearing\nwould serve no purpose, that is a reason to dispense with\nMartinez hearings altogether, not to set \u00a72254(e)(2) aside.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)            21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThus, if that provision applies and the prisoner cannot sat-\nisfy its \u201cstringent requirements,\u201d Michael Williams, 529\nU. S., at 433, a federal court may not hold an evidentiary\nhearing\u2014or otherwise consider new evidence\u2014to assess\ncause and prejudice under Martinez.\n   This follows from our decision in Schriro v. Landrigan,\n550 U. S. 465 (2007). There, we held that a federal court,\n\u201c[i]n deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing, . . .\nmust consider whether such a hearing could enable an ap-\nplicant to prove . . . factual allegations [that] would entitle\n[him] to federal habeas relief.\u201d Id., at 474. \u201cThis approach\nmakes eminent sense,\u201d for if \u201cdistrict courts held eviden-\ntiary hearings without first asking whether the evidence\nthe petitioner seeks to present would satisfy AEDPA\u2019s de-\nmanding standards, they would needlessly prolong federal\nhabeas proceedings.\u201d        Cullen, 563 U. S., at 208\u2013209\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). Here, holding a Martinez\nhearing when the prisoner cannot \u201csatisfy AEDPA\u2019s de-\nmanding standards\u201d in \u00a72254(e)(2) would \u201cprolong federal\nhabeas proceedings\u201d with no purpose. 563 U. S., at 209\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). And because a federal habeas\ncourt may never \u201cneedlessly prolong\u201d a habeas case, ibid.,\nparticularly given the \u201cessential\u201d need to promote the final-\nity of state convictions, Calderon, 523 U. S., at 555, a Mar-\ntinez hearing is improper if the newly developed evidence\nnever would \u201centitle [the prisoner] to federal habeas relief,\u201d\nSchriro, 550 U. S., at 474.\n                              C\n  Ultimately, respondents\u2019 proposed expansion of factfind-\ning in federal court, whether by Martinez or other means,\nconflicts with any appropriately limited federal habeas re-\nview. In our dual-sovereign system, federal courts must af-\nford unwavering respect to the centrality \u201cof the trial of a\ncriminal case in state court.\u201d Wainwright, 433 U. S., at 90.\nThat is the moment at which \u201c[s]ociety\u2019s resources have\n\f22              SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbeen concentrated . . . in order to decide, within the limits\nof human fallibility, the question of guilt or innocence of one\nof its citizens.\u201d Ibid.; see also Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S.\n390, 416 (1993); Davila, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\nSuch intervention is also an affront to the State and its cit-\nizens who returned a verdict of guilt after considering the\nevidence before them. Federal courts, years later, lack the\ncompetence and authority to relitigate a State\u2019s criminal\ncase.\n   The dissent contends that we \u201coverstat[e] the harm to\nStates that would result from allowing\u201d prisoners to develop\nevidence outside \u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s narrow exceptions. Post, at\n17. Not so. Serial relitigation of final convictions under-\nmines the finality that \u201cis essential to both the retributive\nand deterrent functions of criminal law.\u201d Calderon, 523\nU. S., at 555; see also Engle, 456 U. S., at 126\u2013127, and\nn. 32. Further, broadly available habeas relief encourages\nprisoners to \u201c \u2018sandba[g]\u2019 \u201d state courts by \u201cselect[ing] a few\npromising claims for airing\u201d on state postconviction review,\n\u201cwhile reserving others for federal habeas review\u201d should\nstate proceedings come up short. Murray, 477 U. S., at 492;\nsee also Wainwright, 433 U. S., at 89. State prisoners al-\nready have a strong incentive to save claims for federal ha-\nbeas proceedings in order to avoid the highly deferential\nstandard of review that applies to claims properly raised in\nstate court. See \u00a72254(d); Harrington, 562 U.

This\nCourt has recognized that right as \u201ca bedrock principle\u201d\nthat constitutes the very \u201cfoundation for our adversary sys-\ntem\u201d of criminal justice. Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. 1, 12\n(2012). Today, however, the Court hamstrings the federal\ncourts\u2019 authority to safeguard that right. The Court\u2019s deci-\nsion will leave many people who were convicted in violation\nof the Sixth Amendment to face incarceration or even exe-\ncution without any meaningful chance to vindicate their\nright to counsel.\n   In reaching its decision, the Court all but overrules two\nrecent precedents that recognized a critical exception to the\ngeneral rule that federal courts may not consider claims on\nhabeas review that were not raised in state court. Just 10\nyears ago, the Court held that a federal court may consider\n\f2                SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\na habeas petitioner\u2019s substantial claim of ineffective assis-\ntance of trial counsel (a \u201ctrial-ineffectiveness\u201d claim), even\nif not presented in state court, if the State barred the peti-\ntioner from asserting that claim until state postconviction\nproceedings, and the petitioner\u2019s counsel in those proceed-\nings was also ineffective. See id., at 17; see also Trevino v.\nThaler, 569 U. S. 413, 429 (2013). Martinez and Trevino\nestablish that such a petitioner is not at fault for any failure\nto bring a trial-ineffectiveness claim in state court. Despite\nthese precedents, the Court today holds that such a peti-\ntioner is nonetheless at fault for the ineffective assistance\nof postconviction counsel in developing the evidence of trial\nineffectiveness in state court. The Court instead holds that\na petitioner in these circumstances, having received ineffec-\ntive assistance of trial and postconviction counsel, is barred\nfrom developing such evidence in federal court.\n   This decision is perverse. It is illogical: It makes no sense\nto excuse a habeas petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to raise a\nclaim altogether because of ineffective assistance in post-\nconviction proceedings, as Martinez and Trevino did, but to\nfault the same petitioner for that postconviction counsel\u2019s\nfailure to develop evidence in support of the trial-ineffec-\ntiveness claim. In so doing, the Court guts Martinez\u2019s and\nTrevino\u2019s core reasoning. The Court also arrogates power\nfrom Congress: The Court\u2019s analysis improperly reconfig-\nures the balance Congress struck in the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) between state\ninterests and individual constitutional rights.\n   By the Court\u2019s telling, its holding (however implausible)\nis compelled by statute. Make no mistake. Neither AEDPA\nnor this Court\u2019s precedents require this result.

Our Constitu-\ntion insists, however, that no matter how heinous the crime,\nany conviction must be secured respecting all constitutional\nprotections. The history of respondents\u2019 trials and their\nstate postconviction proceedings illustrates the breakdown\nin the adversarial system caused by ineffective assistance\nof counsel, a violation of the Sixth Amendment.\n                              A\n  Respondent Barry Lee Jones was charged with the mur-\nder of his girlfriend\u2019s 4-year-old daughter, Rachel Gray.\nThe State argued that Rachel died as a result of an injury\nshe sustained while in Jones\u2019 care. Jones\u2019 trial counsel\nfailed to undertake even a cursory investigation and, as a\nresult, did not uncover readily available medical evidence\nthat could have shown that Rachel sustained her injuries\nwhen she was not in Jones\u2019 care. Having heard none of this\nevidence, the jury convicted Jones and the trial judge sen-\ntenced him to death.\n  Jones filed for postconviction review in Arizona state\ncourt. Under Arizona law, Jones was not permitted to ar-\ngue on direct appeal that his trial counsel rendered consti-\ntutionally ineffective assistance; accordingly, state postcon-\nviction review was his first opportunity to raise his trial-\nineffectiveness claim. See State v. Spreitz, 202 Ariz. 1, 3,\n39 P. 3d 525, 527 (2002). At this stage, however, Jones was\nmet with another egregious failure of counsel. Arizona\nstate law sets minimum qualifications that attorneys must\nmeet to be appointed in capital cases like Jones\u2019, but the\nArizona Supreme Court waived those requirements in\nJones\u2019 case, and the state court appointed postconviction\ncounsel who lacked those qualifications. See Jones v. Ryan,\n327 F. Supp. 3d 1157, 1214 (Ariz. 2018) (citing Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. \u00a713\u20134041 (2019)). Jones\u2019 new counsel conducted\nalmost no investigation outside of the evidence in the trial\n\f4               SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nrecord. In short, Jones\u2019 postconviction counsel failed to in-\nvestigate the ineffective assistance of Jones\u2019 trial counsel.\nCounsel moved for the appointment of an investigator, but\ndid so under the wrong provision of Arizona law. The mo-\ntion was denied. Counsel ultimately filed a petition for\npostconviction relief that failed to advance any argument\nthat Jones\u2019 trial counsel was ineffective for failing to inves-\ntigate the State\u2019s medical evidence. Arizona courts denied\nthe petition. See ante, at 4\u20135.\n   Jones then sought federal habeas relief, at last repre-\nsented by competent counsel, and alleged that his trial\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance by failing ade-\nquately to investigate his case. The District Court held an\nevidentiary hearing at which Jones presented evidence that\nthe injuries to Rachel could not have been inflicted at the\ntime the State alleged that Jones was with her, and that\nthis evidence would have been readily available to Jones\u2019\ntrial and state postconviction counsel, had they investi-\ngated the case. The District Court concluded that Jones\u2019\npostconviction counsel had rendered ineffective assistance\nin failing to raise this claim in state postconviction proceed-\nings and therefore held that Jones could raise it for the first\ntime in federal court under Martinez. The District Court\nalso relied on this evidence to hold, on the merits, that\nJones received ineffective assistance at trial. The court\nfound that there was a \u201creasonable probability that the jury\nwould not have unanimously convicted [Jones] of any of the\ncounts\u201d if Jones\u2019 trial counsel had \u201cadequately investigated\nand presented medical and other expert testimony to rebut\nthe State\u2019s theory\u201d of Jones\u2019 guilt. 327 F. Supp. 3d, at 1211.\n   Arizona moved to stay the granting of the habeas writ by\narguing that 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(e)(2), a provision enacted as\npart of AEDPA, barred the District Court from considering\non the merits the evidence that Jones developed to satisfy\nMartinez\u2019s requirements.

S., at 11).\n                               B\n   Respondent David Ramirez was convicted for the capital\nmurders of his girlfriend and her daughter. At the sentenc-\ning phase, the state court appointed a psychologist to con-\nduct a mental health evaluation. Ramirez\u2019s counsel failed\nto provide the psychologist with evidence that Ramirez had\nan intellectual disability and failed to develop a claim of in-\ntellectual disability to present in mitigation against the im-\nposition of a death sentence and in support of the imposition\nof a sentence of life without parole. Ramirez was sentenced\nto death.\n   As in Jones\u2019 case, an Arizona state court appointed\nRamirez counsel for his state postconviction claim. And as\nin Jones\u2019 case, state postconviction proceedings were\nRamirez\u2019s first opportunity to raise a claim of trial ineffec-\ntiveness. Ramirez\u2019s postconviction attorney, however, did\nnot conduct any investigation beyond the existing trial rec-\nord, despite being aware of indications that Ramirez might\nhave intellectual disabilities, including that his mother\ndrank when she was pregnant with him and that he demon-\nstrated developmental delays as a child. Nor did Ramirez\u2019s\npostconviction counsel argue that Ramirez\u2019s trial counsel\nprovided ineffective assistance by failing to develop and\npresent this mitigating evidence.

Ramirez v. Ryan, 937 F. 3d 1230, 1238\n(CA9 2019). In his habeas petition, Ramirez raised a claim\nconcerning the ineffectiveness of his trial counsel. In sup-\nport of his claim, Ramirez submitted evidence from family\nmembers, whom trial counsel and state postconviction\ncounsel had never contacted, revealing the depths of abuse\nand neglect Ramirez experienced as a child and the life-long\nmanifestations of his possible disability. The evidence\nshowed that Ramirez grew up eating on the floor and sleep-\ning on dirty mattresses in houses filthy with animal feces;\nthat Ramirez\u2019s mother would beat him with electrical cords;\nand that Ramirez displayed multiple apparent developmen-\ntal delays, including \u201cdelayed walking, potty training, and\nspeech\u201d and inability to maintain basic hygiene or to use\nutensils to eat.

In addition, the court-ap-\npointed psychologist who evaluated Ramirez during the\nsentencing phase of trial averred to the habeas court that if\ntrial counsel had provided him with Ramirez\u2019s school rec-\nords and prior IQ scores, he would have thought they sug-\ngested intellectual disability and insisted on more compre-\nhensive testing.1 Finally, Ramirez\u2019s trial counsel submitted\nan affidavit stating that she had not been \u201cprepared to han-\ndle \u2018the representation of someone as mentally disturbed as\n. . .

In light of this evidence, Ramirez sought an\nopportunity to develop his trial-ineffectiveness claim fur-\nther.2\n   The District Court denied relief on Ramirez\u2019s trial-inef-\nfectiveness claim and declined to allow further evidentiary\ndevelopment. On appeal, Arizona conceded that Ramirez\u2019s\npostconviction counsel performed deficiently. The Ninth\nCircuit reversed and remanded, holding that Ramirez had\nsatisfied the requirements of Martinez because postconvic-\ntion counsel had provided ineffective representation and\nRamirez\u2019s trial-ineffectiveness claim was substantial. The\nNinth Circuit directed the District Court to allow eviden-\ntiary development of Ramirez\u2019s trial-ineffectiveness claim,\nrecognizing that he had been \u201cprecluded from such develop-\nment because of his post-conviction counsel\u2019s ineffective\nrepresentation.\u201d 937 F. 3d, at 1248.\n                             II\n   Martinez and Trevino afford habeas petitioners like\nJones and Ramirez the opportunity to bring certain trial-\nineffectiveness claims for the first time in federal court.\nThe question before the Court is whether Jones and\nRamirez can make good on that opportunity by developing\nevidence in support of these claims, or whether AEDPA\nnevertheless requires them to rely on the state-court rec-\nords, constructed by ineffective trial and postconviction\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The District Court initially denied Ramirez\u2019s petition, and Ramirez\n\nappealed.

S. C. \u00a72254(e)(2).\n   Under this Court\u2019s precedents, the answer is clear. Mar-\ntinez and Trevino establish that petitioners are not at fault\nfor any failure to raise their claims in state court in these\ncircumstances. Other precedents hold that AEDPA\u2019s\n\u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s \u201cfailed to develop\u201d language, too, incorporates\na threshold requirement that the petitioner be at fault for\nnot developing evidence. A petitioner cannot logically be\nfaultless for not bringing a claim because of postconviction\ncounsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, yet at fault for not developing its\nevidentiary basis for exactly the same reason.\n                                A\n   This Court\u2019s precedents, culminating in Martinez and\nTrevino, explain the circumstances under which habeas pe-\ntitioners are deemed accountable for their attorneys\u2019 fail-\nures to present claims in state court. A petitioner who does\nnot properly present a claim in a state proceeding generally\nmay not raise the claim in federal court, because the claim\nhas been \u201cprocedurally defaulted.\u201d See, e.g., Murray v. Car-\nrier, 477 U. S. 478, 486 (1986).\n   A federal court, however, can excuse a procedural default\nand permit a petitioner to raise a claim for the first time in\nfederal court if the petitioner can \u201cdemonstrate cause for\nthe procedural default in state court and actual prejudice\nas a result of the alleged violation of federal law.\u201d Maples\nv. Thomas, 565 U. S. 266, 280 (2012) (internal quotation\nmarks and alterations omitted). This Court has held that\n\u201c[c]ause for a procedural default exists where something ex-\nternal to the petitioner . . . that cannot fairly be attributed\nto him impeded his efforts to comply with the State\u2019s proce-\ndural rule.\u201d Ibid.

Thompson,\n501 U. S. 722, 753 (1991). In certain situations, however,\nattorney error will instead \u201cbe seen as an external factor\u201d\nand therefore constitute cause. Id., at 754. In Maples, we\nheld that where an attorney abandoned his client without\nnotice, \u201cprinciples of agency law and fundamental fairness\u201d\nrequired finding cause to excuse a procedural default, as the\npetitioner had been \u201cdisarmed by extraordinary circum-\nstances quite beyond his control.\u201d 565 U. S., at 289. In\nColeman, we explained that \u201c[a]ttorney error that consti-\ntutes ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d similarly demon-\nstrates cause to excuse procedural default in the context of\na direct appeal. 501 U. S., at 753\u2013754. Coleman explained\nthat error that \u201cconstitutes a violation of petitioner\u2019s right\nto counsel . . . must be seen as an external factor, i.e., \u2018im-\nputed to the State\u2019 \u201d because the Sixth Amendment places\nthe burden of guaranteeing effective assistance of counsel\non the State. Id., at 754.\n   Coleman left unanswered the question whether ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel at the postconviction stage, where\ndefendants generally do not have a constitutional right to\ncounsel, could also constitute cause to excuse default. See\nid., at 755. This question is critical in Arizona and other\nStates that do not allow defendants to raise trial-ineffec-\ntiveness claims on direct appeal, where individuals are con-\nstitutionally entitled to effective counsel, and instead re-\nquire them to raise these claims for the first time in\ncollateral proceedings, in which this Court has not recog-\nnized a constitutional right to counsel.\n   Martinez, 566 U. S. 1, held that in these States, postcon-\nviction counsel\u2019s failure to raise a substantial trial-ineffec-\ntiveness claim could constitute cause to excuse a procedural\ndefault. The Court observed that where a state collateral\nproceeding is the first time that a petitioner can press a\ntrial-ineffectiveness claim, the collateral proceeding is \u201cthe\n\f10                  SHINN v.

Id., at\n8, 11 (quoting Coleman, 501 U. S., at 756). Because this\nresult was occasioned by the State\u2019s \u201cdeliberat[e] cho[ice] to\nmove [such] claims outside of the direct-appeal process,\nwhere counsel is constitutionally guaranteed,\u201d the Court\nheld that the general attorney-attribution rule did not ap-\nply where postconviction counsel rendered ineffective assis-\ntance, just as it would not if appellate counsel on direct re-\nview had done so. Martinez, 566 U. S., at 13\u201314, 16.\nInstead, Martinez held, for a habeas petitioner with a \u201csub-\nstantial\u201d underlying trial-ineffectiveness claim who also\nhas the misfortune of being represented by ineffective post-\nconviction counsel, the failure of postconviction counsel to\nraise the trial-ineffectiveness claim is not properly attribut-\nable to the petitioner. Id., at 14.\n   A year later, in Trevino, 569 U. S. 413, the Court reaf-\nfirmed and extended Martinez\u2019s core holding. Trevino held\nthat where a State does not offer \u201ca meaningful opportunity\nto present a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel\non direct appeal,\u201d a defendant whose collateral-review\ncounsel renders ineffective assistance has demonstrated\ncause to excuse the procedural default of his trial-ineffec-\ntiveness claim. 569 U. S., at 428.3\n                             B\n   There is no dispute here that respondents\u2019 trial-ineffec-\ntiveness claims clear the procedural default hurdle under\nMartinez and Trevino. The question is whether a habeas\npetitioner can be faultless for a procedural default under\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 While Martinez analyzed a state statutory regime that expressly re-\n\nquired defendants to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim on collateral review, Trevino confronted a state statutory regime\nthat left open the theoretical possibility of raising such a claim on direct\nappeal, but made it \u201c \u2018virtually impossible\u2019 \u201d for defendants to do so. 569\nU.

In Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420\n(2000), this Court examined what it means to have \u201cfailed\nto develop the factual basis of a claim\u201d under \u00a72254(e)(2).\nThe Court concluded that this language imposes a fault-\nbased standard, meaning that it erects a bar only to those\nwho bear some responsibility for a lack of evidentiary de-\nvelopment in state-court proceedings. The Court acknowl-\nedged that \u201cfail\u201d is \u201csometimes used in a neutral way, not\nimporting fault or want of diligence.\u201d Id., at 431. As a mat-\nter of ordinary meaning, however, the Court concluded that\n\u201cfail\u201d in \u00a72254(e)(2) connotes \u201csome omission, fault, or neg-\nligence.\u201d Ibid. The Court explained that \u201ca person is not at\nfault when his diligent efforts to perform an act are\nthwarted\u201d by an external force. Id., at 432.\n   Williams found further support for its fault-based read-\ning of \u201cfailed to develop\u201d in pre-AEDPA cases that foreshad-\nowed the language of \u00a72254(e)(2). Specifically, Williams\nnoted the similarity between the text of \u00a72254(e)(2) and the\nlanguage of the Court\u2019s decision in Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes,\n504 U. S. 1 (1992). The Williams Court reasoned that when\nit enacted AEDPA, Congress had \u201craised the bar Keeney im-\nposed on prisoners who were not diligent\u201d (i.e., those who\nwere at fault) \u201cin state-court proceedings.\u201d 529 U. S., at 433\n(emphasis added). At the same time, however, \u201cthe opening\nclause of \u00a72254(e)(2) codifies Keeney\u2019s threshold standard of\ndiligence.\u201d Id., at 434. Phrased differently, under AEDPA,\n\u201c[i]f there has been no lack of diligence at the relevant\nstages in the state proceedings, the prisoner has not \u2018failed\n\f12              SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nto develop\u2019 the facts under \u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s opening clause, and\nhe will be excused from showing compliance with the bal-\nance of the subsection\u2019s requirements.\u201d Id., at 437.\n   The reasoning of Martinez and Trevino applies with equal\nforce to the threshold diligence/fault standard of Keeney,\nWilliams, and \u00a72254(e)(2). Under Williams, whether peti-\ntioners who satisfy Martinez are nevertheless subject to\n\u00a72254(e)(2) turns on whether they were at fault for not de-\nveloping evidence in support of their trial-ineffectiveness\nclaims in state postconviction proceedings. All agree that a\nhabeas petitioner is not at fault when the responsibility for\nan error is properly imputed to the State or to some other\nexternal factor. Martinez cases are among the rare ones in\nwhich attorney error constitutes such an external factor.\nThat is because a State\u2019s \u201cdeliberat[e] cho[ice]\u201d to move trial\nineffectiveness claims outside of direct appeal and into post-\nconviction review \u201csignificantly diminishes prisoners\u2019 abil-\nity to file such claims.\u201d Martinez, 566 U. S., at 13. There is\nnothing nefarious about this choice, but it is \u201cnot without\nconsequences.\u201d Ibid. Together, Martinez, Trevino, and Wil-\nliams demonstrate that when a State both provides a crim-\ninal defendant with ineffective trial counsel and decides to\nremove his trial-ineffectiveness claim from appellate re-\nview, postconviction counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness cannot fairly\nbe attributed to the defendant, and he therefore has not\n\u201cfailed to develop the factual basis of [his] claim.\u201d\n\u00a72254(e)(2).\n   Any other reading hollows out Martinez and Trevino.\nMartinez repeatedly recognized that to prove a trial-ineffec-\ntiveness claim (or even to show that it is \u201csubstantial\u201d), ha-\nbeas petitioners frequently must introduce evidence outside\nof the trial record. See, e.g., 566 U. S., at 13 (\u201cIneffective-\nassistance claims often depend on evidence outside the trial\nrecord\u201d). Ineffective-assistance claims frequently turn on\nerrors of omission: evidence that was not obtained, wit-\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

See Trevino, 569 U. S., at 413 (observing that \u201c \u2018the\ninherent nature of most ineffective assistance\u2019 \u201d claims\nmeans that the \u201ctrial court record will often fail to \u2018contai[n]\nthe information necessary to substantiate\u2019 the claim\u201d); Brief\nfor Federal Defender Capital Habeas Units as Amici Curiae\n4\u20136. Indeed, the very reason States like Arizona might\nchoose to reserve a trial-ineffectiveness claim for a collat-\neral proceeding is to allow development of the factual basis\nfor the claim. Martinez, 566 U. S., at 13. To hold a peti-\ntioner at fault for not developing a factual basis because of\npostconviction counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in the Martinez\ncontext, however, would be to eliminate altogether such ev-\nidentiary development and doom many meritorious trial-in-\neffectiveness claims that satisfy Martinez. Such a rule is\nnot only inconsistent with the reasoning of Martinez and\nTrevino but renders those decisions meaningless in many,\nif not most, cases.\n                                C\n   Applying this interpretation of \u00a72254(e)(2) here makes\nclear that Jones and Ramirez are not at fault for their at-\ntorneys\u2019 failures to develop the state-court record. In Jones\u2019\ncase, the District Court found, and the Ninth Circuit\nagreed, that Jones satisfied the demanding requirements of\nMartinez: Arizona appointed postconviction counsel who\ndid not meet the minimum qualifications for appointment\nand who failed to raise a substantial (indeed, meritorious)\ntrial-ineffectiveness claim. In Ramirez\u2019s case, too, the\nNinth Circuit held that postconviction counsel was ineffec-\ntive for failing to investigate Ramirez\u2019s upbringing (despite\nclear indications of his disability) and for failing to raise or\ndevelop a substantial claim of trial ineffectiveness. The\n\f14              SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nlower courts thus held that both respondents satisfied the\ndemanding requirements of Martinez, holdings that the\nCourt does not question.\n  By definition, Jones and Ramirez are not at fault for their\nstate postconviction counsel\u2019s failures to develop evidence.\nJones and Ramirez acted diligently, but their attorneys\u2019 er-\nrors, paired with the State\u2019s choice of how to structure their\nreview proceedings, constituted external impediments. As\na result, Jones and Ramirez have not \u201cfailed to develop\u201d the\nfactual bases of their claims, and AEDPA\u2019s \u00a72254(e)(2),\nproperly interpreted, poses no bar to evidentiary develop-\nment in federal court.\n                              III\n  Rejecting the teachings of Martinez and Trevino, the\nCourt adopts an irrational reading of \u00a72254(e)(2). The\nCourt begins with the uncontested proposition that, in the\nordinary case, a habeas petitioner \u201c \u2018must bear the risk of\nattorney error.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 11 (quoting Coleman, 501 U. S.,\nat 753). From there, the Court leaps to the conclusion that\na petitioner is at fault for not developing the evidentiary\nrecord on a trial-ineffectiveness claim even if that lack of\ndevelopment was the result of his postconviction counsel\u2019s\nineffective assistance. Ante, at 12.\n  The Court\u2019s analysis rests on two fundamental errors.\nFirst, the Court eviscerates Martinez and Trevino and mis-\ncharacterizes other precedents. Second, the Court relies\nupon its own mistaken understanding of AEDPA\u2019s policies\nand the state interests at issue, recycling claims rejected by\nthe Martinez Court and ignoring the careful balance struck\nby Congress. In doing so, the Court gives short shrift to the\negregious breakdowns of the adversarial system that oc-\ncurred in these cases, breakdowns of the type that federal\nhabeas review exists to correct.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

As explained, those precedents are\npremised on the understanding that a habeas petitioner is\nnot responsible for a postconviction attorney\u2019s ineffective\nfailure to assert a substantial trial-ineffectiveness claim in\nStates that do not offer petitioners a meaningful oppor-\ntunity to raise such claims on direct appeal. The Court,\nhowever, does not grapple with this logic on its own terms.\nInstead, the Court limits Martinez and Trevino to their\nfacts, emptying them of all meaning in the ordinary case\n(where, as those precedents explain, a trial-ineffectiveness\nclaim will necessarily rely on evidence beyond the trial rec-\nord). Tellingly, the Court relies on the dissent in Trevino to\nsupport its disregard of these cases\u2019 reasoning. See ante, at\n18.\n   The Court\u2019s analysis also rests on a misplaced view of\nWilliams. The Court fixates on Williams\u2019 statement that\n\u00a72254(e)(2) \u201craised the bar Keeney imposed on prisoners\nwho were not diligent in state-court proceedings.\u201d 529\nU. S., at 433; see ante, at 16. The Court emphasizes the\nfirst part of that statement while ignoring its qualification:\nthat \u00a72254(e)(2) raised the bar for \u201cprisoners who were not\ndiligent.\u201d In other words, it is undisputed that the \u201cbar for\nexcusing a prisoner\u2019s failure to develop the state-court rec-\nord\u201d is an onerous one, ante, at 12; the question is whether,\nin this context, a habeas petitioner has failed to develop the\nrecord in the first place. Martinez and Trevino make clear\nthat habeas petitioners in Jones\u2019 and Ramirez\u2019s position do\nnot lack diligence and are not at fault for the failures of\ntheir ineffective trial and postconviction counsel.\n   The Court further charges that respondents\u2019 interpreta-\ntion of \u00a72254(e)(2) \u201clacks any principled limit.\u201d Ante, at 17.\nHere again, the Court resuscitates a complaint that previ-\nously was relegated to a dissent. See Martinez, 566 U. S.,\n\f16               SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nat 19 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201c[N]o one really believes that\n[the holding of Martinez] will remain limited to ineffective-\nassistance-of-trial-counsel cases\u201d). The complaint is just as\nunavailing now that it has captured a majority. Respond-\nents\u2019 interpretation only affects habeas petitioners raising\nsubstantial trial-ineffectiveness claims in the subset of\nStates that limit such claims to postconviction review, just\nas Martinez did. In that context, postconviction review is a\nprisoner\u2019s \u201cone and only appeal\u201d of a trial-ineffectiveness\nclaim, Coleman, 501 U. S., at 756 (internal quotation marks\nomitted; emphasis deleted), and the ineffective assistance\nof counsel at that stage forecloses review of a crucially im-\nportant constitutional right. Any assertion that respond-\nents\u2019 interpretation of the statute would blow the door open\nto myriad other claims is hyperbole that this Court, until\ntoday, consistently has rejected.\n   Finally, the Court finds it implausible that Congress\nwould have considered the threshold diligence inquiry un-\nder \u00a72254(e)(2) to account for the Martinez context. Ante,\nat 16\u201317. But Congress legislated against the backdrop of\nColeman. Coleman, in turn, made clear (decades before\nMartinez) that in certain circumstances where attorney er-\nror could be \u201cseen as an external factor, i.e., \u2018imputed to the\nState,\u2019 \u201d including the ineffective assistance of counsel on di-\nrect appeal, the prisoner would not properly be deemed at\nfault. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 754. Moreover, it is not un-\ncommon for Congress to adopt statutory language that in-\ncorporates an evolving judicial doctrine, see, e.g., Kimble v.\nMarvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 461 (2015), and\nthere is no reason this Court should second-guess Congress\u2019\nchoice to incorporate a judicially created diligence doctrine\nhere.\n                              B\n  Much of the Court\u2019s opinion focuses not on the text of\n\u00a72254(e)(2), nor on the relevant precedents, but on what the\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

AEDPA does not render state judg-\nments unassailable, but strikes a balance between respect-\ning state-court judgments and preserving the necessary\nand vital role federal courts play in \u201cguard[ing] against ex-\ntreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice sys-\ntems.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. 86, 102\u2013103 (2011)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, \u201c \u2018Congress\nhas recognized that federal habeas corpus has a particu-\nlarly important role to play in promoting fundamental fair-\nness     in    the    imposition    of    the   death      pen-\nalty.\u2019 \u201d Christeson v. Roper, 574 U. S. 373, 377 (2015) (per\ncuriam). Absent that role, what this Court regularly calls\n\u201cthe Great Writ\u201d hardly would be worthy of the label. See,\ne.g., Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631, 649 (2010).\n   The Court today supplants the balance Congress struck\nwith its single-minded focus on finality. In doing so, it over-\nstates the harm to States that would result from allowing\npetitioners to develop facts in support of Martinez claims.\nSee ante, at 18. Importantly, Martinez applies only where\nthe underlying claim is one of trial ineffectiveness, and only\nif a petitioner demonstrates that the claim is \u201csubstantial.\u201d\n566 U. S., at 14. The Court reaches to support its holding\nby yet again repackaging a dissenter\u2019s warning, this time\n\f18              SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat Martinez would \u201cput a significant strain on state re-\nsources.\u201d Id., at 22 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Nearly a decade\nof experience with Martinez, however, has proved this un-\nfounded prediction false. In a 9-year sample of three States\n(Florida, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina), federal courts\nadjudicated 1,200 habeas petitions raising Martinez claims.\nSee Brief for Habeas Scholars as Amici Curiae 7\u20138. These\ncourts held evidentiary hearings in less than two percent of\nthese cases. Ibid. The lower federal courts, in other words,\nare perfectly capable of policing Martinez\u2019s limits. There is\nno reason to expect that to change from an affirmance here.\n   In the same vein, the Court bemoans the \u201csprawling evi-\ndentiary hearing\u201d conducted by the District Court in Jones\u2019\ncase. Ante, at 19. Of course, the scope of the District Court\u2019s\nhearing (including evidence from medical experts, forensic\nexperts, law enforcement personnel, and others) was neces-\nsary only because trial counsel failed to present any of that\nevidence during the guilt phase of Jones\u2019 capital case. Far\nfrom constituting an inappropriate and \u201cwholesale relitiga-\ntion of Jones\u2019s guilt,\u201d ibid., the District Court\u2019s hearing was\nwide-ranging precisely because the breakdown of the adver-\nsarial system in Jones\u2019 case was so egregious.\n   The Court suggests that evidentiary hearings like Jones\u2019\nwill \u201cencourag[e] prisoners\u201d to \u201c \u2018sandba[g]\u2019 state courts\u201d by\nstrategically holding back claims from state postconviction\nreview to present them for the first time in federal court.\nAnte, at 22. That claim is odd, particularly in this context.\nIt is a State\u2019s decision to divert trial-ineffectiveness claims\nfrom direct appeal to postconviction review, and then to pro-\nvide ineffective postconviction counsel, that results in the\nfailure to raise or develop such claims before state courts.\nNo habeas petitioner or postconviction counsel could possi-\nbly perceive a strategic benefit from failing to raise a meri-\ntorious trial-ineffectiveness claim in an available forum.\nIndeed, the whole thrust of Jones\u2019 and Ramirez\u2019s argument\nis that their Sixth Amendment claims were so obvious that\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U. S. ____ (2022)           19\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntheir state postconviction attorneys were ineffective in fail-\ning to assert them.\n   On the other side of the ledger, the Court understates, or\nignores altogether, the gravity of the state systems\u2019 failures\nin these two cases. To put it bluntly: Two men whose trial\nattorneys did not provide even the bare minimum level of\nrepresentation required by the Constitution may be exe-\ncuted because forces outside of their control prevented them\nfrom vindicating their constitutional right to counsel. It is\nhard to imagine a more \u201cextreme malfunctio[n],\u201d Harring-\nton, 562 U. S., at 102 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nthan the prejudicial deprivation of a right that constitutes\nthe \u201cfoundation for our adversary system,\u201d Martinez, 566\nU. S., at 12.\n   Nor will the damage be limited to these two cases. Even\nbefore Martinez, this Court recognized that a trial record is\n\u201coften incomplete or inadequate\u201d to demonstrate inade-\nquate assistance of counsel. Massaro v. United States, 538\nU. S. 500, 505 (2003). A trial record \u201cmay contain no evi-\ndence of alleged errors of omission,\u201d like a failure suffi-\nciently to investigate a case. Ibid. For a court to discern\n\u201cwhether [any] alleged error was prejudicial,\u201d too, it is ob-\nvious that \u201cadditional factual development\u201d may be re-\nquired. Ibid. The on-the-ground experience of capital ha-\nbeas attorneys confirms this commonsense notion. See\nBrief for Federal Defender Capital Habeas Units as Amici\nCuriae 3\u20134. The Court\u2019s decision thus reduces to rubble\nmany habeas petitioners\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights to the\neffective assistance of counsel.\n   Contrary to the Court\u2019s account, the fundamental fair-\nness concerns that arise from this particular type of break-\ndown are not unconditionally eclipsed by the need to accord\nfinality and respect to state-court judgments. Ante, at 18.\nFinality interests are at their apex when the \u201cessential ele-\nments of a presumptively accurate and fair proceeding were\npresent in the proceeding whose result is challenged.\u201d\n\f20               SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694 (1984). The\neffective assistance of counsel is one of those essential ele-\nments. See Martinez, 566 U. S., at 12. When the effective\nassistance of counsel is absent, leaving a severely dimin-\nished basis for presuming fairness and accuracy, \u201cfinality\nconcerns are somewhat weaker.\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n694. Neither statute nor precedent supports the Court\u2019s as-\nsertion that the virtues of finality override fundamental\nfairness to such a degree that meaningful review of life-or-\ndeath judgments obtained through such deeply flawed pro-\nceedings should be foreclosed.\n   Ultimately, the Court\u2019s decision prevents habeas peti-\ntioners in States like Arizona from receiving any guaran-\nteed opportunity to develop the records necessary to enforce\ntheir Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of\ncounsel. For the subset of these petitioners who receive in-\neffective assistance both at trial and in state postconviction\nproceedings, the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee is now an\nempty one. Many, if not most, individuals in this position\nwill have no recourse and no opportunity for relief. The re-\nsponsibility for this devastating outcome lies not with Con-\ngress, but with this Court.\n                          *     *    *\n   Text and precedent instruct that in States that limit re-\nview of trial-ineffectiveness claims to postconviction pro-\nceedings, habeas petitioners who receive ineffective assis-\ntance of both trial and postconviction counsel are not\nresponsible for any failure to raise their substantial claim\nof trial ineffectiveness, nor for any \u201cfail[ure] to develop\u201d ev-\nidence in support of that claim under AEDPA\u2019s \u00a72254(e)(2).\nBy holding otherwise, the Court not only extinguishes the\ncentral promise of Martinez and Trevino, but it makes illu-\nsory the protections of the Sixth Amendment.

To overcome proce-\n  dural default in such cases, a prisoner must demonstrate \u201ccause\u201d to\n  excuse the procedural defect and \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d Coleman v.\n  Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\">501 U.

The State of Arizona pe-\n    titioned this Court in both cases, arguing that \u00a72254(e)(2) does not per-\n    mit a federal court to order evidentiary development simply because\n    postconviction counsel is alleged to have negligently failed to develop\n    the state-court record.\nHeld: Under \u00a72254(e)(2), a federal habeas court may not conduct an evi-\n dentiary hearing or otherwise consider evidence beyond the state-court\n record based on the ineffective assistance of state postconviction coun-\n sel.

Two of those costs\n are particularly relevant here. First, a federal order to retry or release\n a state prisoner overrides the State\u2019s sovereign power to enforce \u201csoci-\n etal norms through criminal law.\u201d Calderon v.

Pp. 6\u20138.\n      (2) In light of these costs, this Court recognizes that federal ha-\n beas review is not \u201ca substitute for ordinary error correction through\n appeal,\u201d but is an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d that guards only against\n \u201cextreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems.\u201d Harring-\n ton v.

To ensure that federal habeas\n retains its narrow role, both Congress and federal habeas courts have\n set out strict rules requiring prisoners to raise all of their federal\n claims in state court before seeking federal relief.

Pp. 14\u201315.\n            (ii) Respondents propose extending Martinez so that ineffective\n    assistance of postconviction counsel can excuse a prisoner\u2019s failure to\n    develop the state-court record under \u00a72254(e)(2). But unlike judge-\n    made exceptions to procedural default, \u00a72254(e)(2) is a statute, and\n    thus, this Court has no power to redefine when a prisoner \u201chas failed\n    to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings.\u201d Nor\n    is it plausible, as respondents contend, that Congress might have en-\n    acted \u00a72254(e)(2) with the expectation that this Court would one day\n    open the door to allowing the ineffective assistance of state postconvic-\n    tion counsel to be cause to forgive procedural default. Finally, Mar-\n    tinez itself cuts against respondents\u2019 proposed result. Martinez fore-\n    closed any extension of its holding beyond the \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to\n    procedural default at issue in that case. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625711\"><a href=\"/opinion/625711/martinez-v-ryan/\">566 U. S., at 9</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. That\n    assurance has bite only if the State can rely on the state-court record.\n    The cases here demonstrate the improper burden imposed on the\n    States when Martinez applies beyond its narrow scope, with the\n    sprawling evidentiary hearing in Jones\u2019 case being particularly poign-\n    ant. Pp. 15\u201319.\n          (2) Respondents propose a second reading of \u00a72254(e)(2) that sup-\n    posedly permits consideration of new evidence in their habeas cases.\n    First, they argue that because \u00a72254(e)(2) bars only \u201can evidentiary\n    hearing on the claim,\u201d a federal court may hold an evidentiary hearing\n    to determine whether there is cause and prejudice.

MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor the first time during state postconviction proceedings.\n  Often, a prisoner with a defaulted claim will ask a federal\nhabeas court not only to consider his claim but also to per-\nmit him to introduce new evidence to support it. Under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), the standard to expand the state-court record is\na stringent one. If a prisoner has \u201cfailed to develop the fac-\ntual basis of a claim in State court proceedings,\u201d a federal\ncourt \u201cshall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim\u201d\nunless the prisoner satisfies one of two narrow exceptions,\nsee </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U.

We conclude that it does not.\n                             I\n  In this case, we address two petitions brought by the\nState of Arizona. See Ramirez v.

As relevant here, the District Court held\nthat Ramirez had procedurally defaulted his ineffective-\nassistance claim by failing to raise it before the Arizona\ncourts in a timely fashion. See App. 402\u2013403. Ramirez re-\nsponded that the District Court should forgive the proce-\ndural default because his state postconviction counsel was\nhimself ineffective for failing to raise the trial-ineffective-\nassistance claim and develop the facts to support it.\n   The District Court permitted Ramirez to file several dec-\nlarations and other evidence not presented to the state\ncourt to support his request to excuse his procedural de-\nfault. See 937 F. 3d, at 1238. Assessing the new evidence,\nthe District Court excused the procedural default but re-\njected Ramirez\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim on the merits.\nSee id., at 1240.\n   The Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded.

See\nid., at 1247\u20131248. The Ninth Circuit also held that\nRamirez\u2019s underlying trial-ineffective-assistance claim was\nsubstantial, and that Ramirez therefore had suffered prej-\nudice. See id., at 1243\u20131247. But, unlike the District\nCourt, the Court of Appeals declined to decide the merits of\nRamirez\u2019s claim.

The Arizona Supreme Court\nsummarily denied relief. See ibid.\n  Jones next filed a habeas petition in the U. S. District\nCourt for the District of Arizona. The District Court held\nthat Jones\u2019 trial-ineffective-assistance claim was procedur-\nally defaulted, so Jones, like Ramirez, invoked his postcon-\nviction counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance as grounds to forgive\nthe default. Ibid. To bolster his case for cause and preju-\ndice, Jones also moved to supplement the undeveloped\nstate-court record. Ibid. The District Court held a 7-day\nevidentiary hearing with more than 10 witnesses and ulti-\nmately decided to forgive Jones\u2019 procedural default. See id.,\nat 1219, 1225\u20131226. The court then relied on the new evi-\ndence from the cause-and-prejudice hearing to hold, on the\nmerits, that Jones\u2019 trial counsel had provided ineffective as-\nsistance. See id., at 1219.\n  Arizona appealed, arguing that \u00a72254(e)(2) did not per-\nmit the evidentiary hearing. The Ninth Circuit affirmed,\nholding that \u00a72254(e)(2) did not apply because Jones\u2019 state\npostconviction counsel was ineffective for failing to develop\nthe state-court record for Jones\u2019 trial-ineffective-assistance\nclaim.

Respondents contend that\nwhere, per Martinez, a prisoner is not responsible for state\npostconviction counsel\u2019s failure to raise a claim, it makes\nlittle sense to hold the prisoner responsible for the failure\nto develop that claim.

Not\neven Martinez sweeps that broadly.\n   Finally, setting aside that we lack authority to amend\n\u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s clear text, Martinez itself cuts against re-\nspondents\u2019 proposed result. Martinez was \u201cunusually ex-\nplicit about the narrowness of our decision.\u201d Trevino, 569\nU. S., at 431 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting).

The sprawling evidentiary hearing in\nJones is particularly poignant. Ostensibly to assess cause\nand prejudice under Martinez, the District Court ordered a\n7-day hearing that included testimony from no fewer than\n10 witnesses, including defense trial counsel, defense post-\nconviction counsel, the lead investigating detective, three\nforensic pathologists, an emergency medicine and trauma\nspecialist, a biomechanics and functional human anatomy\nexpert, and a crime scene and bloodstain pattern analyst.\nSee 943 F. 3d, at 1219, 1225\u20131226. Of these witnesses, only\none of the forensic pathologists and the lead detective testi-\nfied at the original trial. See id., at 1223\u20131225. The re-\nmainder testified on virtually every disputed issue in the\ncase, including the timing of Rachel Gray\u2019s injuries and her\ncause of death. See id., at 1226\u20131228. This wholesale re-\nlitigation of Jones\u2019 guilt is plainly not what Martinez envi-\nsioned.\n                              B\n  Martinez aside, respondents propose a second reading of\n\u00a72254(e)(2) that supposedly permits consideration of new\nevidence in their habeas cases. Their interpretation pro-\nceeds in two steps. First, respondents argue that because\n\u00a72254(e)(2) bars only \u201can evidentiary hearing on the claim,\u201d\n\f20              SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na federal court may hold an evidentiary hearing to deter-\nmine whether there is cause and prejudice. In respondents\u2019\nview, a so-called \u201cMartinez hearing\u201d is not a \u201chearing on the\nclaim.\u201d \u00a72254(e)(2) (emphasis added). Second, with that\nevidence admitted for cause and prejudice, respondents\ncontend that the habeas court may then consider the new\nevidence to evaluate the merits of the underlying ineffective-\nassistance claim. By considering already admitted evi-\ndence, respondents reason, the habeas court is not holding\na \u201chearing\u201d that \u00a72254(e)(2) otherwise would prohibit. Ibid.\n   There are good reasons to doubt respondents\u2019 first point,\nbut we need not address it because our precedent squarely\nforecloses the second. In Holland, we explained that\n\u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s \u201crestrictions apply a fortiori when a prisoner\nseeks relief based on new evidence without an evidentiary\nhearing.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137004\"><a href=\"/opinion/137004/holland-v-jackson/\">542 U. S., at 653</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (emphasis deleted). The basis\nfor our decision was obvious: A contrary reading would have\ncountenanced an end-run around the statute. Federal ha-\nbeas courts could have accepted any new evidence so long\nas they avoided labeling their intake of the evidence as a\n\u201chearing.\u201d Therefore, when a federal habeas court convenes\nan evidentiary hearing for any purpose, or otherwise ad-\nmits or reviews new evidence for any purpose, it may not\nconsider that evidence on the merits of a negligent pris-\noner\u2019s defaulted claim unless the exceptions in \u00a72254(e)(2)\nare satisfied.\n   Respondents all but concede that their argument\namounts to the same kind of evasion of \u00a72254(e)(2) that we\nrejected in Holland. They nonetheless object that Holland\nrenders many Martinez hearings a nullity, because there is\nno point in developing a record for cause and prejudice if a\nfederal court cannot later consider that evidence on the\nmerits. While we agree that any such Martinez hearing\nwould serve no purpose, that is a reason to dispense with\nMartinez hearings altogether, not to set \u00a72254(e)(2) aside.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

This\nCourt has recognized that right as \u201ca bedrock principle\u201d\nthat constitutes the very \u201cfoundation for our adversary sys-\ntem\u201d of criminal justice. Martinez v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625711\"><a href=\"/opinion/625711/martinez-v-ryan/\">566 U. S. 1</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12\n(2012). Today, however, the Court hamstrings the federal\ncourts\u2019 authority to safeguard that right. The Court\u2019s deci-\nsion will leave many people who were convicted in violation\nof the Sixth Amendment to face incarceration or even exe-\ncution without any meaningful chance to vindicate their\nright to counsel.\n   In reaching its decision, the Court all but overrules two\nrecent precedents that recognized a critical exception to the\ngeneral rule that federal courts may not consider claims on\nhabeas review that were not raised in state court. Just 10\nyears ago, the Court held that a federal court may consider\n\f2                SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\na habeas petitioner\u2019s substantial claim of ineffective assis-\ntance of trial counsel (a \u201ctrial-ineffectiveness\u201d claim), even\nif not presented in state court, if the State barred the peti-\ntioner from asserting that claim until state postconviction\nproceedings, and the petitioner\u2019s counsel in those proceed-\nings was also ineffective. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625711\"><a href=\"/opinion/625711/martinez-v-ryan/\">id., at 17</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; see also Trevino v.\nThaler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">569 U. S. 413</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 429 (2013). Martinez and Trevino\nestablish that such a petitioner is not at fault for any failure\nto bring a trial-ineffectiveness claim in state court. Despite\nthese precedents, the Court today holds that such a peti-\ntioner is nonetheless at fault for the ineffective assistance\nof postconviction counsel in developing the evidence of trial\nineffectiveness in state court. The Court instead holds that\na petitioner in these circumstances, having received ineffec-\ntive assistance of trial and postconviction counsel, is barred\nfrom developing such evidence in federal court.\n   This decision is perverse. It is illogical: It makes no sense\nto excuse a habeas petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to raise a\nclaim altogether because of ineffective assistance in post-\nconviction proceedings, as Martinez and Trevino did, but to\nfault the same petitioner for that postconviction counsel\u2019s\nfailure to develop evidence in support of the trial-ineffec-\ntiveness claim. In so doing, the Court guts Martinez\u2019s and\nTrevino\u2019s core reasoning. The Court also arrogates power\nfrom Congress: The Court\u2019s analysis improperly reconfig-\nures the balance Congress struck in the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) between state\ninterests and individual constitutional rights.\n   By the Court\u2019s telling, its holding (however implausible)\nis compelled by statute. Make no mistake. Neither AEDPA\nnor this Court\u2019s precedents require this result.

Our Constitu-\ntion insists, however, that no matter how heinous the crime,\nany conviction must be secured respecting all constitutional\nprotections. The history of respondents\u2019 trials and their\nstate postconviction proceedings illustrates the breakdown\nin the adversarial system caused by ineffective assistance\nof counsel, a violation of the Sixth Amendment.\n                              A\n  Respondent Barry Lee Jones was charged with the mur-\nder of his girlfriend\u2019s 4-year-old daughter, Rachel Gray.\nThe State argued that Rachel died as a result of an injury\nshe sustained while in Jones\u2019 care. Jones\u2019 trial counsel\nfailed to undertake even a cursory investigation and, as a\nresult, did not uncover readily available medical evidence\nthat could have shown that Rachel sustained her injuries\nwhen she was not in Jones\u2019 care. Having heard none of this\nevidence, the jury convicted Jones and the trial judge sen-\ntenced him to death.\n  Jones filed for postconviction review in Arizona state\ncourt. Under Arizona law, Jones was not permitted to ar-\ngue on direct appeal that his trial counsel rendered consti-\ntutionally ineffective assistance; accordingly, state postcon-\nviction review was his first opportunity to raise his trial-\nineffectiveness claim. See State v. Spreitz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">202 Ariz. 1</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"867612\"><a href=\"/opinion/867612/state-v-spreitz/\">39 P. 3d 525</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 527 (2002). At this stage, however, Jones was\nmet with another egregious failure of counsel. Arizona\nstate law sets minimum qualifications that attorneys must\nmeet to be appointed in capital cases like Jones\u2019, but the\nArizona Supreme Court waived those requirements in\nJones\u2019 case, and the state court appointed postconviction\ncounsel who lacked those qualifications. See Jones v. Ryan,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">327 F. Supp. 3d 1157</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1214 (Ariz. 2018) (citing </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ariz. Rev.\nStat.

In short, Jones\u2019 postconviction counsel failed to in-\nvestigate the ineffective assistance of Jones\u2019 trial counsel.\nCounsel moved for the appointment of an investigator, but\ndid so under the wrong provision of Arizona law. The mo-\ntion was denied. Counsel ultimately filed a petition for\npostconviction relief that failed to advance any argument\nthat Jones\u2019 trial counsel was ineffective for failing to inves-\ntigate the State\u2019s medical evidence. Arizona courts denied\nthe petition. See ante, at 4\u20135.\n   Jones then sought federal habeas relief, at last repre-\nsented by competent counsel, and alleged that his trial\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance by failing ade-\nquately to investigate his case. The District Court held an\nevidentiary hearing at which Jones presented evidence that\nthe injuries to Rachel could not have been inflicted at the\ntime the State alleged that Jones was with her, and that\nthis evidence would have been readily available to Jones\u2019\ntrial and state postconviction counsel, had they investi-\ngated the case. The District Court concluded that Jones\u2019\npostconviction counsel had rendered ineffective assistance\nin failing to raise this claim in state postconviction proceed-\nings and therefore held that Jones could raise it for the first\ntime in federal court under Martinez. The District Court\nalso relied on this evidence to hold, on the merits, that\nJones received ineffective assistance at trial. The court\nfound that there was a \u201creasonable probability that the jury\nwould not have unanimously convicted [Jones] of any of the\ncounts\u201d if Jones\u2019 trial counsel had \u201cadequately investigated\nand presented medical and other expert testimony to rebut\nthe State\u2019s theory\u201d of Jones\u2019 guilt. 327 F.

At the sentenc-\ning phase, the state court appointed a psychologist to con-\nduct a mental health evaluation.

Ramirez was sentenced\nto death.\n   As in Jones\u2019 case, an Arizona state court appointed\nRamirez counsel for his state postconviction claim. And as\nin Jones\u2019 case, state postconviction proceedings were\nRamirez\u2019s first opportunity to raise a claim of trial ineffec-\ntiveness. Ramirez\u2019s postconviction attorney, however, did\nnot conduct any investigation beyond the existing trial rec-\nord, despite being aware of indications that Ramirez might\nhave intellectual disabilities, including that his mother\ndrank when she was pregnant with him and that he demon-\nstrated developmental delays as a child. Nor did Ramirez\u2019s\npostconviction counsel argue that Ramirez\u2019s trial counsel\nprovided ineffective assistance by failing to develop and\npresent this mitigating evidence.

In his habeas petition, Ramirez raised a claim\nconcerning the ineffectiveness of his trial counsel.

The evidence\nshowed that Ramirez grew up eating on the floor and sleep-\ning on dirty mattresses in houses filthy with animal feces;\nthat Ramirez\u2019s mother would beat him with electrical cords;\nand that Ramirez displayed multiple apparent developmen-\ntal delays, including \u201cdelayed walking, potty training, and\nspeech\u201d and inability to maintain basic hygiene or to use\nutensils to eat. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id., at 1239</span><pre class=\"inline\">. In addition, the court-ap-\npointed psychologist who evaluated Ramirez during the\nsentencing phase of trial averred to the habeas court that if\ntrial counsel had provided him with Ramirez\u2019s school rec-\nords and prior IQ scores, he would have thought they sug-\ngested intellectual disability and insisted on more compre-\nhensive testing.1 Finally, Ramirez\u2019s trial counsel submitted\nan affidavit stating that she had not been \u201cprepared to han-\ndle \u2018the representation of someone as mentally disturbed as\n. . .

Mar-\ntinez and Trevino establish that petitioners are not at fault\nfor any failure to raise their claims in state court in these\ncircumstances. Other precedents hold that AEDPA\u2019s\n\u00a72254(e)(2)\u2019s \u201cfailed to develop\u201d language, too, incorporates\na threshold requirement that the petitioner be at fault for\nnot developing evidence. A petitioner cannot logically be\nfaultless for not bringing a claim because of postconviction\ncounsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, yet at fault for not developing its\nevidentiary basis for exactly the same reason.\n                                A\n   This Court\u2019s precedents, culminating in Martinez and\nTrevino, explain the circumstances under which habeas pe-\ntitioners are deemed accountable for their attorneys\u2019 fail-\nures to present claims in state court.

The Court acknowl-\nedged that \u201cfail\u201d is \u201csometimes used in a neutral way, not\nimporting fault or want of diligence.\u201d Id., at 431. As a mat-\nter of ordinary meaning, however, the Court concluded that\n\u201cfail\u201d in \u00a72254(e)(2) connotes \u201csome omission, fault, or neg-\nligence.\u201d Ibid. The Court explained that \u201ca person is not at\nfault when his diligent efforts to perform an act are\nthwarted\u201d by an external force. Id., at 432.\n   Williams found further support for its fault-based read-\ning of \u201cfailed to develop\u201d in pre-AEDPA cases that foreshad-\nowed the language of \u00a72254(e)(2). Specifically, Williams\nnoted the similarity between the text of \u00a72254(e)(2) and the\nlanguage of the Court\u2019s decision in Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112728\"><a href=\"/opinion/112728/keeney-v-tamayo-reyes/\">504 U. S. 1</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992). The Williams Court reasoned that when\nit enacted AEDPA, Congress had \u201craised the bar Keeney im-\nposed on prisoners who were not diligent\u201d (i.e., those who\nwere at fault) \u201cin state-court proceedings.\u201d 529 U. S., at 433\n(emphasis added). At the same time, however, \u201cthe opening\nclause of \u00a72254(e)(2) codifies Keeney\u2019s threshold standard of\ndiligence.\u201d Id., at 434. Phrased differently, under AEDPA,\n\u201c[i]f there has been no lack of diligence at the relevant\nstages in the state proceedings, the prisoner has not \u2018failed\n\f12              SHINN v.

Under Williams, whether peti-\ntioners who satisfy Martinez are nevertheless subject to\n\u00a72254(e)(2) turns on whether they were at fault for not de-\nveloping evidence in support of their trial-ineffectiveness\nclaims in state postconviction proceedings. All agree that a\nhabeas petitioner is not at fault when the responsibility for\nan error is properly imputed to the State or to some other\nexternal factor. Martinez cases are among the rare ones in\nwhich attorney error constitutes such an external factor.\nThat is because a State\u2019s \u201cdeliberat[e] cho[ice]\u201d to move trial\nineffectiveness claims outside of direct appeal and into post-\nconviction review \u201csignificantly diminishes prisoners\u2019 abil-\nity to file such claims.\u201d Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625711\"><a href=\"/opinion/625711/martinez-v-ryan/\">566 U.

To hold a peti-\ntioner at fault for not developing a factual basis because of\npostconviction counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in the Martinez\ncontext, however, would be to eliminate altogether such ev-\nidentiary development and doom many meritorious trial-in-\neffectiveness claims that satisfy Martinez. Such a rule is\nnot only inconsistent with the reasoning of Martinez and\nTrevino but renders those decisions meaningless in many,\nif not most, cases.\n                                C\n   Applying this interpretation of \u00a72254(e)(2) here makes\nclear that Jones and Ramirez are not at fault for their at-\ntorneys\u2019 failures to develop the state-court record. In Jones\u2019\ncase, the District Court found, and the Ninth Circuit\nagreed, that Jones satisfied the demanding requirements of\nMartinez: Arizona appointed postconviction counsel who\ndid not meet the minimum qualifications for appointment\nand who failed to raise a substantial (indeed, meritorious)\ntrial-ineffectiveness claim. In Ramirez\u2019s case, too, the\nNinth Circuit held that postconviction counsel was ineffec-\ntive for failing to investigate Ramirez\u2019s upbringing (despite\nclear indications of his disability) and for failing to raise or\ndevelop a substantial claim of trial ineffectiveness. The\n\f14              SHINN v. MARTINEZ RAMIREZ\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nlower courts thus held that both respondents satisfied the\ndemanding requirements of Martinez, holdings that the\nCourt does not question.\n  By definition, Jones and Ramirez are not at fault for their\nstate postconviction counsel\u2019s failures to develop evidence.\nJones and Ramirez acted diligently, but their attorneys\u2019 er-\nrors, paired with the State\u2019s choice of how to structure their\nreview proceedings, constituted external impediments. As\na result, Jones and Ramirez have not \u201cfailed to develop\u201d the\nfactual bases of their claims, and AEDPA\u2019s \u00a72254(e)(2),\nproperly interpreted, poses no bar to evidentiary develop-\nment in federal court.\n                              III\n  Rejecting the teachings of Martinez and Trevino, the\nCourt adopts an irrational reading of \u00a72254(e)(2). The\nCourt begins with the uncontested proposition that, in the\nordinary case, a habeas petitioner \u201c \u2018must bear the risk of\nattorney error.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 11 (quoting Coleman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\">501 U.

From there, the Court leaps to the conclusion that\na petitioner is at fault for not developing the evidentiary\nrecord on a trial-ineffectiveness claim even if that lack of\ndevelopment was the result of his postconviction counsel\u2019s\nineffective assistance. Ante, at 12.\n  The Court\u2019s analysis rests on two fundamental errors.\nFirst, the Court eviscerates Martinez and Trevino and mis-\ncharacterizes other precedents. Second, the Court relies\nupon its own mistaken understanding of AEDPA\u2019s policies\nand the state interests at issue, recycling claims rejected by\nthe Martinez Court and ignoring the careful balance struck\nby Congress. In doing so, the Court gives short shrift to the\negregious breakdowns of the adversarial system that oc-\ncurred in these cases, breakdowns of the type that federal\nhabeas review exists to correct.\n\f                  Cite as: 596 U.

As explained, those precedents are\npremised on the understanding that a habeas petitioner is\nnot responsible for a postconviction attorney\u2019s ineffective\nfailure to assert a substantial trial-ineffectiveness claim in\nStates that do not offer petitioners a meaningful oppor-\ntunity to raise such claims on direct appeal. The Court,\nhowever, does not grapple with this logic on its own terms.\nInstead, the Court limits Martinez and Trevino to their\nfacts, emptying them of all meaning in the ordinary case\n(where, as those precedents explain, a trial-ineffectiveness\nclaim will necessarily rely on evidence beyond the trial rec-\nord). Tellingly, the Court relies on the dissent in Trevino to\nsupport its disregard of these cases\u2019 reasoning. See ante, at\n18.\n   The Court\u2019s analysis also rests on a misplaced view of\nWilliams. The Court fixates on Williams\u2019 statement that\n\u00a72254(e)(2) \u201craised the bar Keeney imposed on prisoners\nwho were not diligent in state-court proceedings.\u201d 529\nU. S., at 433; see ante, at 16. The Court emphasizes the\nfirst part of that statement while ignoring its qualification:\nthat \u00a72254(e)(2) raised the bar for \u201cprisoners who were not\ndiligent.\u201d In other words, it is undisputed that the \u201cbar for\nexcusing a prisoner\u2019s failure to develop the state-court rec-\nord\u201d is an onerous one, ante, at 12; the question is whether,\nin this context, a habeas petitioner has failed to develop the\nrecord in the first place. Martinez and Trevino make clear\nthat habeas petitioners in Jones\u2019 and Ramirez\u2019s position do\nnot lack diligence and are not at fault for the failures of\ntheir ineffective trial and postconviction counsel.\n   The Court further charges that respondents\u2019 interpreta-\ntion of \u00a72254(e)(2) \u201clacks any principled limit.\u201d Ante, at 17.\nHere again, the Court resuscitates a complaint that previ-\nously was relegated to a dissent.

The complaint is just as\nunavailing now that it has captured a majority. Respond-\nents\u2019 interpretation only affects habeas petitioners raising\nsubstantial trial-ineffectiveness claims in the subset of\nStates that limit such claims to postconviction review, just\nas Martinez did. In that context, postconviction review is a\nprisoner\u2019s \u201cone and only appeal\u201d of a trial-ineffectiveness\nclaim, Coleman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\">501 U.

Any assertion that respond-\nents\u2019 interpretation of the statute would blow the door open\nto myriad other claims is hyperbole that this Court, until\ntoday, consistently has rejected.\n   Finally, the Court finds it implausible that Congress\nwould have considered the threshold diligence inquiry un-\nder \u00a72254(e)(2) to account for the Martinez context.

Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\">466 U. S. 668</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694 (1984). The\neffective assistance of counsel is one of those essential ele-\nments. See Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625711\"><a href=\"/opinion/625711/martinez-v-ryan/\">566 U. S., at 12</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. When the effective\nassistance of counsel is absent, leaving a severely dimin-\nished basis for presuming fairness and accuracy, \u201cfinality\nconcerns are somewhat weaker.\u201d Strickland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\">466 U. S., at\n694</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Neither statute nor precedent supports the Court\u2019s as-\nsertion that the virtues of finality override fundamental\nfairness to such a degree that meaningful review of life-or-\ndeath judgments obtained through such deeply flawed pro-\nceedings should be foreclosed.\n   Ultimately, the Court\u2019s decision prevents habeas peti-\ntioners in States like Arizona from receiving any guaran-\nteed opportunity to develop the records necessary to enforce\ntheir Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of\ncounsel. For the subset of these petitioners who receive in-\neffective assistance both at trial and in state postconviction\nproceedings, the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee is now an\nempty one. Many, if not most, individuals in this position\nwill have no recourse and no opportunity for relief. The re-\nsponsibility for this devastating outcome lies not with Con-\ngress, but with this Court.\n                          *     *    *\n   Text and precedent instruct that in States that limit re-\nview of trial-ineffectiveness claims to postconviction pro-\nceedings, habeas petitioners who receive ineffective assis-\ntance of both trial and postconviction counsel are not\nresponsible for any failure to raise their substantial claim\nof trial ineffectiveness, nor for any \u201cfail[ure] to develop\u201d ev-\nidence in support of that claim under AEDPA\u2019s \u00a72254(e)(2).\nBy holding otherwise, the Court not only extinguishes the\ncentral promise of Martinez and Trevino, but it makes illu-\nsory the protections of the Sixth Amendment.
