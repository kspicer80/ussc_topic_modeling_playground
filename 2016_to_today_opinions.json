We are unanimously of opinion, that the construction insisted on by the claimant\u2019s counsel, is the only correct construction. It is perfectly clear, that the case of this vessel is not literally comprised within the provisions of this act; for it only prohibits a voyage from a closed port of Great Britain to a port of the United States ; and the purport and effect of the latter part of the first clause, amounts to no more than a declaration, that the continuity of such voyage shall not be broken by the act of touching at, or clearing out from, any port of a colony or territory of Great Britain 'which may be open to American shipping.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">But it has been contended, in behalf of the appellants, that although not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>within the letter, it is within the mischief intended to be obviated by the statute, and, therefore, subject to the penalty. If, by this argument, it be intended to maintain, that acts done in fraud of a.law, are acts in violation of the law, the principle may be conceded ; but we fully concur in the views of the policy of this law, as explained by the claimant\u2019s counsel, and are satisfied, that the latter provisions of the first clause were solely intended to guard against the effects which the permission of a general trade at one or more of the British colonial ports, may have had in defeating the policy of the act altogether. The legislature had not in view a fair *unaffected trade through the ports of any other nation. It is obvious, that attempts might have been made to evade the law, by an affected trade through an intermediate port; and it is not to be supposed, that this government, or its courts, would have failed to check such an <em>attempt; but </em>we are fully satisfied, that this was not such a case. The evidence of fairness is full and unequivocal. There was time, even upon ordinary calculation, to have completed the voyage from Jamaica to Old Providence, and thence to Philadelphia, before the prohibition was by law to take effect, as is proved by the fact of her having arrived in the Delaware, at a time which left it doubtful whether she was, or was not, within the period specified for its suspension. The cargo, too, was taken in at the port of Old Providence, and was of a description well known to belong to the trade of that port, from its having been the depot of captures, and probably of a covered trade from the continent of South America. Everything conspires to exempt the vessel from the charge of fraudulent intention, and therefore, leaves no ground for the condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Decree of the circuit court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>", "html_with_citations": "", "extracted_by_ocr": true, "opinions_cited": []}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/8373760/", "id": 8373760, "absolute_url": "/opinion/8403417/la-nereyda/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/8403417/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2022-10-17T19:25:19.070570-07:00", "date_modified": "2022-10-17T19:25:19.070583-07:00", "author_str": "Stoet", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "020lead", "sha1": "", "page_count": null, "download_url": null, "local_path": null, "plain_text": "", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "<opinion type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AqMW\">Stoet, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"A5x\">delivered the opinion of the court. \u2014 This cause was heard at the last term, and an order was then made, requiring the claimant to produce a copy of the libel, or other paper on which the sentence was founded, or to account for the non-production of such document ; and also requiring the production of further proof of the reality of the asserted sale of the Nereyda, and of the proprietary interest of the asserted owner. The cause has now been argued upon the further proof brought in by the parties, and stands for the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">^The Nereyda was a Spanish ship of war, and was captured by the privateer Irresistible, of which John D. Daniels was commander, and Henry Childs (the claimant), a lieutenant, under an asserted commission of the Oriental Republic of Rio de la Plata, and was carried into Margaritta, in Venezuela, and there condemned as prize to the captors, by the vice-admiralty court of that island. A sale is asserted to have been there made of her to the claimant, Francesche, after condemnation, for the sum of $30,000. She soon afterwards left Margaritta, under the command of Childs, who was the original prize-master, and arrived at Baltimore, the place of residence of Childs and Daniels, who are both American citizens ; and her subsequent history, after seizure and delivery upon stipulation or bail to the claimant, shows, that she has continued exclusively under the control, management and direction of the same persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The order to produce the libel, or to account for the omission, was made upon the fullest consideration by the court. Whoever sets up a title under a condemnation, is bound to show, that the court had jurisdiction of the cause ; and that the sentence has been rightly pronounced, upon the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>cation of parties competent to ask it. For this purpose, it is necessary to show who are the captors, and how the court has acquired authority to decide the cause. In the ordinary cases of belligerent capture, no difficulty arises on this subject, for the courts of the captors have general jurisdiction Pr\u2019ze&gt; an&lt;l their adjudication is conclusive *upon the proprietary interest. But where, as in the present case, the capture is made by captors acting under the commission of a foreign country, such capture gives them a right which no other nation, neutral to them, has authority to impugn, unless for the purpose of vindicating its own violated neutrality. The courts of another nation, whether an ally, or a co-belligerent only, can acquire no general right to entertain cognisance of the cause, unless by the assent, or upon the voluntary submission, of the captors. In such a case, it is peculiarly proper to show the jurisdiction of the court, by an exemplification of the proceedings anterior to the sentence of condemnation. And in all cases, it is the habit of courts of justice, to require the production of the libel, or other equivalent document, to verify the nature of the case, and ascertain the foundation of the claim of forfeiture as prize.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Notwithstanding the direct order for the production of the libel in this case, none has been produced ; nor has the slightest reason been given, to account for its non-production. The general usage of maritime nations, to proceed, in prize causes, to adjudication in this manner, either by a formal libel, or by some equivalent proceeding, is so notorious, that the omission of it is not to be presumed on the part of any civilized government, which professes to proceed upon the principles of international law. How, then, are we to account for the omission in this case ? If, by the course of proceeding in Venezuela, a libel does not constitute any part of the acts of its courts, cou^ easily shown. The neglect to show this, or in any manner to account for the non-production of the libel, if it exists, cannot but give l\u00e1se to unfavorable susjficions as to the whole transaction. And where an order for further proof is made, and the party disobeys its injunctions, or neglects to comply with them, courts of prize are in the habit of considering such negligence as contumacy, leading to presumptions fatal to his claim. We think, in this case, that the non-production of the libel, under the circumstances, would justify the rejection of the claim of Francesche.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Upon the other point, as to the proprietary interest of Francesche, under the asserted sale, there is certainly very positive testimony of witnesses to the reality of the sale to him, and to his ability to make the purchase. And if this testimony stood alone, although it is certainly not, in all respects, consistent or harmonious, no difficulty would be felt, in allowing it entire judicial credence. But it is encountered by very strong circumstances on the other side ; and circumstances will sometimes outweigh the most positive testimony. It is remarkable, that from the institution of this cause up to the present time, a period of nearly four years, Francesche has not, by any personal act, made himself a party to. the cause. He has never made any affidavit of proprietary interest; he has never produced any document verified by his testimony ; he has never recognised the claim made in his behalf ; he has never, so far as we have any knowledge, advanced any money for the defence of it. Yet, the brig is admitted *to have been a valuable vessel, and was purchased, as is asserted, for the large sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>of $30,000. Upon an order of further proof, it is the usual, and almost invariable practice, for the claimant to make proofs, on his own oath, of his proprietary interest, and to give explanations of the nature, origin and character of his rights, and of the difficulties which surround them. This it is so much the habit of courts of prize to expect, that the very absence of such proofs always leads to considerable doubts. How are we to account for such utter indifference and negligence on the part of Franeesche, as to the fate of so valuable a property ? Is it consistent with the ordinary prudence which every man applies to the preservation of his own interest ? Can it be rationally explained, but upon the supposition, that his interest in this suit is nominal, and not real.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">This is not all. Immediately after the ostensible sale to Franeesche, the Nereyda was put in command of Childs, an American citizen, who was an utter stranger to him, so far as we have any means of knowledge, and sailed for Baltimore, the home port of the Irresistible, and the domicil of Daniels and Childs. There is no evidence, that she has ever revisited Margaritta, and there is positive evidence, that she has, for the three last years, be in habits of intimacy with the ports of the United States. Where are the owner\u2019s instructions, given to the master, on his departure to Baltimore ? Where is the documentary evidence of Francesche\u2019s ownership ? Where are the proofs of his disbursements for the vessel, *during her subsequent voyages ? From the time of her voyage to Baltimore, she has remained under the management of Daniels or Childs, or some other apparent agent of Daniels. She has undergone extensive repairs, her rig has been altered, heavy expenses have been incurred, and a new master has been appointed to her. Under whose authority have all these acts been done ? Where are the orders of Franeesche for these acts ? Daniels has constantly been connected with the vessel; he has superintended her repairs ; he or his agents have paid the bills ; he is the reputed owner of the vessel; and he has been consulted as to the material operations. How can all these things be, and yet the real owner be a foreigner, a Venezuelian ? How can he be presumed to lie by, without any apparent interposition in the destiny of his own vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">There are some other extraordinary circumstances in the case. The Nereyda arrived at Margaritta, under the command of Childs, as prize-master ; and in a few days afterwards, Daniels arrived there with the Irresistible. The crew of the latter vessel ran away with her ; and Daniels then sailed in the Nereyda, in pursuit of the privateer, and of course, on a voyage for his own peculiar benefit. How is this reconcilable with the supposition of a real sale to Franeesche ? What interest had the latter in regaining the Irresistible, or subduing a revolted crew ? Why should his vessel, after .that object was accomplished, have gone to Baltimore ? Why should he intrust to strangers, for a voyage in which he had no apparent interest, *so valuable a property ? If he made any contract for that voyage, why is not that contract px-oduced ? These are questions which it seems very difficult to answer, in any manner useful to the asserted proprietary interests of Franeesche. Yet the facts, to which allusion is here made, are drawn from the further pi-oof of the claimant; and this further proof, it is not immaterial to observe, comes, not fi-om Margaritta, where Fi-ancesche resided, and for aught that appears, still resides ; but from Laguayra, with which he is not shown to have any immediate connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Looking, therefore, to all the circumstances of the case, the fact of the unchanged possession of the captors, the habits of the vessel, the apparent control of the property by Daniels, the utter absence of all proper documentary proofs of ownership, instructions, disbursements, and even connection with her, on the part of the claimant, we think that there is the strongest reason to believe, that no real sale ever took place, and that the property remains still in the original captors, unaffected by the asserted transfer. The positive evidence is completely borne down by the strong and irresistible current of circumstantial evidence which opposes it. Upon both grounds, therefore, viz., the omission to produce the original libel, or account for its non-production, and the insufficiency of the proofs of proprietary interest, the court are of opinion, that the cause must be decided against the asserted claim.</p>\n<p id=\"ATU\">Ifthis be so, then, as it is clear, that the original *outfit of the privateer Irresistible was illegal, upon the principles already established by this court, the property of the Uereyda remains in his majesty the King of Spain, and ought to be restored accordingly. The decree of the circuit court is, therefore, reversed, and the Uereyda is ordered to be restored to the libellant, with costs of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>", "html_with_citations": "", "extracted_by_ocr": true, "opinions_cited": []}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/8373759/", "id": 8373759, "absolute_url": "/opinion/8403416/cohens-v-virginia/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/8403416/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2022-10-17T19:25:17.742120-07:00", "date_modified": "2022-10-17T19:25:17.742136-07:00", "author_str": "Marshall", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "020lead", "sha1": "", "page_count": null, "download_url": null, "local_path": null, "plain_text": "", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "<opinion type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Aqqp\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"A7jj\">Mr, Chief Justice Marshall.</author>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">This case was stated in the opinion given on the motion f\u00f3r dismissing the writ of error for want of jurisdiction in the Court.

It is in these words:</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AWU\">The act qf Congress, em-pow~rah~. the Corpo~ion of the C~f~ of Washington to authoii~e the (lrswing of lot-ter~es~ c~oes not purpnr-t, and was not intend. ed, to author. ire the Corporation to force the sale of hi tickets n~ such lotterks in States where such sale is pro. bibited by the State laws.</headnotes>\n<blockquote id=\"A_5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>\u201c The said Corporation shall have full power to authorize the drawing of lotteries for effecting any important improvement in th City, which the ordinary funds or revenue thereof will not accomplish: Provided, that the sum to.be raised in each year shall not exceed the amount of 10,000 dollars: And provided, also, that the object for which the money is intended to be raised shall be first submitted to the President of the United States, and shall be approved of by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO9x\">Two questions arise on this act.</p>\n<p id=\"APMi\">1st. Does it purport to authorize the Corporation to force the sale of these lottery tickets in States where such sales may be prohibited by law ? If it does,</p>\n<p id=\"A-y\">2d. Is the law constitutional ?</p>\n<p id=\"AWvr\">If the first question be answered in the affirmative, it will become necessary to consider the second. If it should be answered in the negative, it will be unnecessary, and consequently improper, to pursue any inquiries, which would then be merely speculative, respecting the power of Congress in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqn\">In inquiring into the extent of the power granted to the Corporation of Washington, we rnust first examine the words of the grant. We find in them no expression which looks beyond the limits of the City. The powers granted are all of them local in their nature, and all of them such as would, in the common course of things, if not necessarily, be exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>within the city. The subject on which Congress ~vas employed when framing this act was a local subject; it was not the establishment of a lottery, but the formation of a separate body for the management of the ii. ernal affa~r~ of the City, for its internal government, for its police. Congress must have considered itself as delegating to this corporate body powers for these objects, and fbr these objects solely. In delegating these powers, therefore, it seems reasonable to suppose that the mind of the legislature was directed to the City alone, to the action of the being they were creating within the City, and not to any extra-territorial operations. In describing the pnwers of such a being, no words of II-mitation need be used. They are limited \u2022by the subject. But, if it be intended to give its acts a binding eftIcacy beyond the natural limits of its power, and within the jurisdiction of a distinct power, we should expect to find, in the language of the incorporating act, some words indicating such intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Without such words, we cannot suppose that Congress designed to give to the acts of the Corporation any other effect, beyond its limits, than attends every act having the sa~iction of local law, when aiiy thi4lg depends uj~on it which is to be~ transacted elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">If this would be the reasonable construction of corporate powth generally it is more especially proper in a case where an attempt is made so to exercise those powers as to control and limit the penal laws of a State. This is an operation which was not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>we think, in the contemplation of the legislature, while incorporating the City of Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"A72U\">To interfere with the pena! laws of a State, where they are not levelled against the legitimate powers of the Union, but have for their sole object the internal government of the country, is a very serious mear sure, which Congress cannot be supposed to adopt lightly, or inconsiderately. The motives for it must be serious and weighty. It would be taken deliberately, and the intention would be clearly and unequivocally expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"A6j1\">An act, such as that under consideration, ought not, we think, to be so construed as to imply this intention, unless its provisions were such as to render the construction inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"AHF\">We do not think it essential to the corporate power in question, that it should be exercised out of the City. Could-the lottery be drawn iii any State of the Union ? Does the corporate power to authorize the drawing of a lottery imply a power to authorize its being drawn without the jurisdiction of a Corporation, in a place where it may be prohibited by law ? This, we think, would scarcely be asserted. And what clear legal distinction can be taken be-tw\u00e9en a power to draw a lottery in a place where it is prohibited by law, and a power to establish an office for the sale of tickets in a place where it is prohibited by law <em>? </em>It may be urged, that the place where the lottery is drawn is of no importance to the ' Corporation, and therefore the act need not be so construed as to give power over the place, but that the right to sell tickets throughout the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>States is of importance, and thereforfe ought to be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"AjF\">. . \u2022 <em>r </em>That the power to sell tickets m every part of tjie United States might facilitate their sale, is not to be denied; but it does not follow that Congress designed, for <em>the </em>purpose of giving this increased facility, to overrule the penal laws of the several States. In the City of Washington, the great metropolis of the nation, visited by individuals, from every part of the Union, tickets may be-freely sold to all who are willing to purchase. Can if be affirmed that this is so limited a market, that the incorporating act must be extended .beyond its words, and made, to conflict .with the internal police of the States, unless it be construed to give a more extensive market?</p>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">It has been said, that the States cannot make it unlawful to buy that which Congress has made it lawful to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"AQE\">This proposition is not denied; and, therefore, the validity of a law punishing a citizen of Virginia for purchasing a ticket in the City of Washington, might well be drawn into question. Such a law would be a direct attempt to counteract and defeat a measure authorized by the United States. But a law to punish the sale of lottery tickets in Virginia, is of a different character. Before we can impeach its validity, we must inquire whether Congress in- . tended to empower this Corporation to do any act within a State which the laws of that State might prohibit.</p>\n<p id=\"AeY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>In addition to the very important circumstance, that the act contains no words indicating such inten-tioir, and that this extensive construction is not essential to the execution of the corporate power, the Court cannot resist the conviction, that the intention ascribed to this act, had it existed, would have been executed by very different means from those which have been employed.</p>\n<p id=\"ADB\">Had Congress intended to establish a lottery for those improvements in the City which are deemed national, the lottery itself would have become the subject of legislative consideration. It would be organized by law,' and agents for its execution would be appointed by the President, or in such other manner as the law might direct. If such agents were to act out of the District, there would be, probably, some provision made for such a state of things, and in making such provisions Congress would examine its power to make them. The whole subject would be under the control of the government, or of persons appointed by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"A0R\">But in this case no lottery is established by law, no control is exercised by the government over any which'may be established. The lottery emanates from*a corporate power. The Corporation may authorize, or not authorize it,, and may select the purposes to which the proceeds are to be applied. This Corporation. is a being intended for local objects only. All its capacites are limited to the City. This, as well as every other law it is capable of making, is a by-law, and, from its nature, is only co-extensive with the City. It is not probable that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>such an agent would be employed in the execution of a lottery established by Congress; but when it acts, not as the agent for carrying into effect a lottery established by Congress, but in its own corporate capacity, from its own corporate powers, it is reasonable to suppose that its acts were intended to partake of . the nature of that capacity and of those powers; and, like all' its other acts, be merely local in its nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\">The proceeds of these lotteries are to come in aid of the revenues of the City. These revenues are raised by laws whose operation is entirely local, and for objects which are also .-local; for no person will suppose, that the President\u2019s house, the Capitol, the Navy Yard, or other public' institution, was to be benefitted by these lotteries, or was to form a charge on the City revenue. Coming in aid of\u2018the City revenue, they are. of the same character with it j. the mere creature of a corporate power.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The circumstances, that the lottery cannot be drawn without the permission of the President, and that this resource is to be used only. for important improvements, have been relied on as giving'to this corporate power a inore extensive operation than is given to those with which it is associated. We do not think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The President has no agency in the lottery. It does not originate with him, nor is the improvement to which its profits are to be applied to be selected by him. Congress has not enlarged the corporate power by restricting its exercise to cases of which' the President might approve.</p>\n<p id=\"Acq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>We very readily admit, that the act establishing the seat of government, and the act appointing commissioners to superintend the public buildings, are laws of universal obligation. We admit, too, that the laws of any . State to defeat the loan authorized by Congress, would have been void, as would have been any attempt to arrest the progress of the canal, or of any other measure which Congress may adopt. These, and all other laws relative to theDistrict, have the authority which may be claimed by other acts of the national legislature ; but their extent is to be determined by those rules of construction, which are applicable to all. laws. The act incorporating the Gity of Washington, is, unquestionably,' of universal obligation ; but the extent of the corporate powers conferred by that act, is to be determined by those considerations which belong to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"Af0\">Whether, we consider the general -character of a law incorporating a City, the objects for which such law is usually made, or the words in which this p\u00e1rticular power is conferred,, we arrive at the same result. The Corppration was merely empowered to authorize the drawing of lotteries; and the mind.of Congress was not directed to any provision for the sale of the tickets beyond the limits of the Corporation. That subject does not seen! to have been taken into view. It is the unanimous opinion of the Court, that the law cannot be construed to embrace it.</p>\n<p id=\"ALa\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A3Vg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Judgment.

And on the question being put thereupon, the same were agreed to unanimously, by the House, as follows: The Committee to whom was referred the communication of the Governor of Pennsylvania, covering certain reso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>lutions of the Legislature of that State, proposing an amend-nient to the constitution of the United States, by the appointment of an impartial tribunal to decide disputes between the State and federal judiciary, have had the same under their consideration, and are of opinion that a tribunal is already provided by the Constitution of the United States, to wit: The Supreme Court, more eminently qualified from their habits and duties, from the mode of their selection, and from the tenure of their offices, to decide the disputes aforesaid, in an enlightened and impartial manner, than any other tribunal which could be created. The members of the Supreme- Court are selected from those in the United States who are most celebrated for virtue and legal learning, not at the will of a single individual, \u25a0but by the concurrent wishes of the President and Senate of the United States ; they will, therefore, have no local prejudices and partialities. The duties they have to perform lead them necessarily to the most' enlarged and accurate acquaintance with the jurisdiction of the federal, and several State Courts, together with the admirable symmetry of our Government. The tenure of their offices enables them to pronounce the sound and correct opinions they may have formed, without fear, fa-vour, or partiality. The amendment to the constitution proposed by Pennsylvania, seems to be founded upon the. idea that the federal judiciary will, from a lust of power, enlarge their jurisdiction, to the total annihilation of the jurisdiction of the State Courts ; that they will exercise their will instead of the law and the constitution. This argument, if it proves any thing, would operate more strongly against the tribunal proposed to be created, which promises so little, than against the Supreme Court, which, for the reasons given before, have every thing connected with their appointment, calculated to insure confidence. What security have we, were the proposed amendment adopted, that this tribunal would not substitute their will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>and their pleasure in place of the law ? The judiciary are the weakest of (he three departments of government, and least dangerous <em>to the </em>political rights of the constitution. They hold neither the purse nor the sword ; and even to enforce their own judgments and decrees, must ultimately depend upon the executive arm. Should the federal judiciary, however, unmindful of their weakness, unmindful of the duty which they-owe to themselves and their country, become corrupt, and transcend the limits of their jurisdiction, would the proposed amendment oppose even a probable barrier to such an improbable state of things ? The creation of a tribunal such as is proposed by Pennsylvania, so far as we are enabled to form an idea of it, from the description given in the resolutions of the legislature of that State, would, in the opinion of your Committee, tend rather to invite, than prevent a collision between the federal and State Courts. It might also become, in process of time, a serious and dangerous embarrassment to the operations of the general Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Resolved, therefore, that the legislature of this State do disapprove of the amendment to the constitution of the United States proposed by the legislature of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Resolved, also, that his excellency the Governor be, and is hereby requested to transmit forthwith, a copy of the foregoing preamble and resolutions to each of the Senators and Representatives of this State, in Congress, and to the executives of the several States in the Union, and request that the same be laid before the legislatures thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">Extract from the Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">\u201c <em>Tuesday, January </em>23, 1810.

The Marshal, probably, without any improper views,, or an intention of making use of the proceeds of the vessel and cargo, disobeys the order of the Judge, and instead of de-. positing them in the registry of the Court, keeps them under his own control, and finally distributes them among, the parties without any direction of the Court on the subject. This was a great irregularity,, but the owners of the schooner Collector and cargo have, no right at this day to complain of it. They were early apprised of the situation of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>property. Two <em>of </em>them gave an order on the Marshal for their proportion of the proceeds before any sale had taken place ; and the other, who is the present appellant, received of <em>the </em>Marshal his share before the sentence of reversal, which was pro4-nounced here, had been made known to the Court below. After this ratification, or sanction, on their part, of the irregular conduct of the Marshal, neither of them ought now to be permitted to seek any other redress from him. Before any distribution of the proceeds by the Marshal,, they might have applied to the Court to enforce obedience to its order, as it regarded the bringing of them into Court, and then have had their respective pretensions adjudicated by the Court itself. Not having proceeded in this manner, the District Court, if it have jurisdiction of the case, could not now, without great danger of doing -injustice, interfere in this business. Whatever notice it might have taken of the lien, which is now set up by the appellant, on a part of these proceeds beyond his moiety, if the proceeds were still in that Court, it is by no means clear, - that the Marshal ought now to be rendered liable to the appellant for them, there being nothing like satisfactory pr\u00f3of^ that he^had notice of such a claim when the appellant <em>toolt </em>from him his moiety, nor until long after he had parted with the whole of the property. Under this view of the case, the Court is of opinion, that the appellant, under the particular circumstances of this case, is not entitled, on the merits, to any relief against the Marshal. But the Court is further of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>opinion, that the proceeding on the present petition, and that in the District Court, was <em>coram nonjudice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ao7\">By an appeal from the sentence of a District Court to a Circuit Court, 1 the latter becomes possessed of the cause, and executes its own judgment without any intervention of the former. It is fit, therefore, tha; the proceeds of the property, if it have been converted into money, should follow the appeal into the Circuit Court, and be deposited in such bank, or other place, as it may direct, there to remain, subject to the disposition and direction of the Circuit Court. And if the property at the time of the appeal remain in specie in the Marshal\u2019s custody, and any order or direction shall become necessary for its sale or preservation after an appeal, such order must emanate from the Circuit Court. But if a further appeal be had to the Supreme Court, the property, or its proceeds, will still continue in the Circuit Court, because the Supreme Court, in such cases, does not execute its own judgments, but sends a special mandate to the Circuit Court to award execution thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The proceeds, therefore, of the Collector and cargo, at the time of filing the present petition and libel, even if the order of the District Court in relation to them, had been complied with, could not, after the appeal, be regarded as in, or under, the control of the District Court, which was, therefore, incompetent, when this petition was filed, to.make any order respecting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Sentence affirmed, with costs.-</p>\n</opinion>", "html_with_citations": "", "extracted_by_ocr": true, "opinions_cited": []}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/8373757/", "id": 8373757, "absolute_url": "/opinion/8403414/united-states-v-palmer/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/8403414/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2022-10-17T19:25:16.336427-07:00", "date_modified": "2022-10-17T19:25:16.336440-07:00", "author_str": "Marshai", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "020lead", "sha1": "", "page_count": null, "download_url": null, "local_path": null, "plain_text": "", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "<opinion type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ak-\">Mr. Chief Justice Marshai.l</author>\n<p id=\"A5z\">delivered the opinion of the court. In. this case, a series of questions has been proposed by the circuit court of the United States, for the district of Massachusetts, on which the judge\u00ae of that court were divided in opinion. The questions occurred on the trial of John Palmer, Thomas Wilson, and Barney Calloghan, who were indicted for piracy committed on the high seas.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The first four questions, relate to the construction of the 8th section of the \u201cact for the punishment of certain crimes against t*he United States!.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The remaining seven questions^ respect the rights of a colony or other portion of an established empire, which has proclaimed itself an independent nation, and is asserting and maintaining its claim to independence by urns.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">The 8th ssecjion of the act on which these prison-were- indicted is in these words: \u201cAnd be it Enacted, that\" if any person or nersons shall com-, ' . mit, upon the high seas, or in any river, haven, bason, or bay, out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, murder or robberv, or any other .offence, within the body of a county would, by the law's of the United States, be punisha. ' , ... \u2022 \u2022 <em>r </em>ble with death; or if any captain or manner &gt;of any ship or other vessel, shall piratically and feloniously suit away with. such ship or vessel, or any goods or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>merchandize, to the value of fifty dollars or yield up such ship or vessel voluntarily to any pirate ; or if any seaman shall lay violent hands upon his com*, mander, thereby to hinder and prevent his fighting-in defence of his ship, or goods committed to his trust? or shall make a revolt in the ship; every such offend er shall be deemed, taken, and adjudged to he a pirate and felon, and being thereof convicted, shall suffer death; and the trial of, crimes committed on the high seas, or in any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, shall be in the district where the offender is apprehended, or into which he may first be brought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\">Robbery committed on land, not being punishable by the laws of the United States with death, it is doubted whether it is made piracy by this act, when committed On the high seas. The argument is understood to he, that congress did not intend to make that'a capital offe ice on the high seas, which is not a capital offence on lam\u00ed. That only such murder, and. such robbery, and such other offence as, if committed within the body of a county, would, by the laws of the United States, be punishable .with death, is made piracy. That the word \u201cother\u201d is without use or meaning, if this conctruction be rejected. That it so connects murder and robbery with the following member of the sentence, as to limit the words murder and robbery to that description of those offences which might be made punishable with death, if committed on land. That in consequence of this word, the relative \u201cwhich\u201d has fot its antecedent the whole preceding part of the sentence, and not the words \u201cother offences.\u201d That section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>consists of three distinct classes of piracy. The first of offences which if committed within the body of a county, wpuld be punishable with death. The se* c'oncl and third, of particular offences which are enu- , , merated.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">This argument is entitled to. great respect on every account; and to. the more, because, in. expounding a law which inflicts capital punishment, no over -rigid construction ought to be admitted. But the court .cannot assent t\u00f3 its correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"AMW\">The legislature having specified murder and robbery particularly, are understood to indicate clearly the intention that those offences shall amount to piracy; there could be no other motive-for. specifying them. The subsequent, words d\u00f3 not appear to be employed for the purpose of limiting piratical murder and robbery, to that description of those offences which- is punishable with death, if committed on land, but for-the purpose of adding other offences, should there be any, which were not particularly .recited, and \u00abwhich were rendered capital by the laws of the Uni-'fed States, if committed within the body of a county. Had the intention of congress been to render the crime of piracy dependent on the punishment affixed to the same offence, if committed on land, this intention must have been expressed in very different terms \u25a0from those which .have been selected.' Instead of enumerating murder and rribbery as crimes which should constitute piracy, and then-proceeding to use a general term, comprehending other 'offences, the language of the legislature would have been, that \u201cmy offence\u201d committed on the high seas, which, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>committed in the body of a county, would be punisha. ble with death, should amount to piracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\">The particular crimes enumerated were undoubtedly first in the mind of congress. No other motive for the enumeration can be assigned. Yet on the construction contended for, robbery on the high seas would escape unpunished. It is not pretended that the words of the legislature ought to be strained beyond their natural meaning, ror the purpose of embracing a crime which would otherwise escape with impunity; Wit when the words of a statute, in their most obvious sense, comprehehd an offence, which offence is apparently -placed by the legislature in the highest class of crimes, it furnishes an additional motive far rejecting a construction, narrowing the plain meaning of the words, that such construction would leave the crime entirely \u00abunpunished.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The correctness-of this exposition of the 8th section is confirmed by those which follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The Qth punishes those citizens of the United States who commit the offences described in the 8th, under colour of a commission or authority derived from a foreign state. Here robbery is again particularly -specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The 10th section extends the punishment of death to accessories before the fact. They are described to be those who aid, assist, advise, &amp;c. &amp;c any person to \u201ccommit any .murder, robbery,, or <em>&lt; </em>ther piracy aforesaid.\u201d If the . word \u201caforesaid\u201d be conne'cted with \u201cmurder\u201d and . \u201crobbery,\u201d as well as with \u201cother piracy,\u201d yet it seems difficult, to resist .the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>conviction that the legislature considered paurder and robbery as acts of piracy..</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AmZ\">The robbery, as mentioned in thcactofi790 crime of robbe ry as recogniz ed and defined law.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"API\">mb\u00edcry^'com mitted by a person who is hota citizen en the higl\u00ed o^a' ahip^be riTely^to^Mb jects of a reign state, \u00cd3 not piracy un U court\u00ae *of</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The 11th section punishes acccessories after the fact. They are those who, \u201cafter any murder, felony, <em>robbery., </em>or other piracy whatsoever, aforesaid,?\u2019 shall have been committed, shall furnish aid to those by whom the crime has been perpetrated. Can it be doubted, that the. legislature considered murder, felony, and robbery, committed to the high seas, as piracies ?</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">If it be answered, that although this opinion was \"tertained, yet, if the legislature was mistaken, those whose duty it is to construe the law, must not yield to' that mistake ; we say, that when the legislature manifests this clear understanding of its own intention, which consists with its words, courts are bound by \u2022.</p>\n<p id=\"ARVh\">of raean\u00a1ng 0f t},e term robbery, as used in the tatute, we think no doubt can be entertained. It must a be understood in the sense <em>in </em>which it is recognized and defined at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"A3b\">The question, whether this act extends farther than to Americ\u00fcn citizens, or to persons on board Ameri- . \u2019 . . can vessels, or to \u2022 offences committed against cit-zens of the United States, is not without its difficulties. The constitution having conferred on congress Power defining and punishing piracy, there be no doubt of the right of the legislature . . . <em>' </em>, to enact laws punishing pirates, although they may foreigners, and may have committed n\u00f3 particu\u00b0ffence against the United States, The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>question is, has the legislature enacted such a law ? Do the words of the act authorize the courtsof the union-to inflict its penalties on persons who are not citizens of the United States, nor sailing under their flag, \u00f1or <em>offending </em>particularly against them?</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The words of the section are in terms of unlimited extent. The words \u201cany person or persons,\u201d are broad enough to comprehend every human being.. But.general words must not only be limited tocases within the jurisdiction*of the1 state, but also to those objects to which the legislature intended to apply them. Did the legislature intend to apply these words to the subjects of a foreign power, who. in a foreign ship may commit murder or robbery. on the high seas ?</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The title of an act cannot control its words, but may furnish some aid in showing what was in the mind of the legislature. The title of this act is, \u201can act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States.\u201d It would Seem that offences against the United States, not offences against the human race, were the crimes which the legislature intended by this law to punish.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The act proceeds, upon this idea,'and uses general terms in this limited sense. In describing those wh&amp; may commit misprision of treason or felony, the words used are \u201cany petson or persons yet these words are necessarily confined to any person or persons owing permaraent or temporary allegiance to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The 8th section also commences with the words \u00abany person or persons.\u201d But these words must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>limited in some degree, and the'intent of the legislature will determine the extent of this limitation. For this intent we must examine the law. The sucreeding member of the sentence commences with the words, \u201cif any captain or mariner of any ship or other vessel, shall piratically run 'away with sueh ship or vessel, or any goods or merchandize, to the value of fifty dollars\u00bb or yield up such ship or vessel voluntarily to any pirate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\">The words \u201cany captain, onmaoner of any ship1 or other vessel,\u201d ' comprehend- all captains and mariners, as entirely as the words \u201cany person or persons,\u201d comprehend the whole human race. Yet it would be difficult to believe that the legislature intended to punish the captain or mariner of a- foreign ship,, who should fun away with such ship,, and. dispose of her in a foreign port, or who should steal any goods from such ship to the value of fifty - dollars,, or who should deliver her up to a pirate when he; might have defended her, or- even according to prb1-vious arrangement. The third member .of the' sentence also begins with the general words \u201cany- sea\" man. But it; cannot be supposed that the legisla-' ture intended to punish a seaman on board a ship sailing under a foreign flag, under the jurisdiction of a foreign government, who should lay violent hands up. on his commander, or make a revolt in the ship. These are offences against the nation under whose flag the vessel sails, and within whose particular jurisdiction all on board the vessel are. Every- nation provides for such offences the punishment its own policy may dictate ; and no general words of a statute ought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>be construed to embrace them when committed by for-' eigners against a foreign government.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">That the general words'of the two latter members of this sentence are to be restricted to offences committed <em>' </em>on board the'vessels of the United States, furnishes strong reason for believing that the legislature intended to impose the same restriction on the general words .used.in the first member of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">This construction derives aid from the 10th section of the ac,t. &gt; That section declares, that <em>\u201c any person\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>who shall \u201cknowingly and wittingly aid and assist, procure, command, counsel, or advise, any person or persons, to do or commit any murder or robbery, &amp;c.\u201d shall be-an accessory before the fact, and, on conviction, shall suffer death.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">It will scarcely be denied that the words \u201c any person,\u201d when applied to aiding or advising a fact, are as extensive as the same words when applied to the commission of that fact. Can it be believed that the legislature intended to punish with death the subject of a foreign prince, who, within the dominions of that prince, should advise a person, about to sail in the ship of his sovereign, to commit murder or robbery ? If the advice is not a crime within the law, neither is the fact advised a crime within the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">The opiniori formed by the court on this subject might be still farther illustrated by animadversions on other sections of the act. But it would be tedious, and is thought unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">The court is of opinion that the crime of robbery, committed by a person on the high seas, on board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>any ship or vessel belonging exclusively to subjects of a foreign state, on persons within a vjessel .bqlonging exclusively to subjects of a foreign stale,, is not a piracy within the true intent and meaning of the act for ^ pUn\u00a1s},meat of certain , crimes against the United States;</p>\n<headnotes id=\"A-p\">Whim a civil war rages in a Wished* esta\u2019 vernment, \u00abreels itself into a distinct \u00a7\u00bb!*courts^of vieivrach new <em>iy </em>constituted government uisviewed by and executive \u2022\u00ab\u00abntQfihe U.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">This opinion will probably decide the case to which, it is intended to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Those questions which respect the rights of a part of a foreign empire, which asserts,and is contending for independence, and the conduct which must he observby the courts of the union towards the subjects of such section of an empire who may be brought before tribunals of this country, are equally delicate and <em>i J </em>dlfnc ult.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">As it is understood that the construction which bas been given to the a.ct of congress, will render a particular answer to them unnecessary, the court will . \u2018 . only observe, that such questions are generally rather political than legal in their character. They belong properly to tuose who can declare what the law shall be ; who can place the nation in such a position with respect to foreign powers as to their own judgment shall appear wise ; to whom are entrusted all its. foreign relations ; than to that tribunal whose power as well as duty is confined to the application of the. rule which the legislature may prescribe forjt. In such contests a nation may engage itself with the one. party or the other \u2014 may observe absolute.neutrality \u2014 - may recognize the new state absolutely \u2014 or may make a limited recognition of it. The proceeding, in courts mpt depend so entirely on the course^ of the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>mentj that it is difficult to give a precisp answer tb questions which do not refer to \u00e1 particular nation.\u2014 It may be said, generally, that .ii the government remains neutral, and recognizes the existence of a civil war, its courts cannot consider as criminal those acts of hostility which war authorizes, and which the new government may direct against its enemy. To decide other wise,, would be to determine that the war prosecuted by one of the parties was unlawful, and would be to arrange the nation to which the court belongs' against that party. This would transcend the limits prescribed to the judicial department.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AA7\">The\u00bbair.e twbmony which would be suffident to prove that a vessel or person is in the service of an acknowledged, state, is admissible to prove that they nrein the service of a newly created government</headnotes>\n<p id=\"AnY\">it follows as a consequence, from this of the , . . subject that persons or vessels employeu the service \u00f3f a self declared government, thus acknowledged to be maintaining its separate existence by war, must be permitted to prove the fact of their being actually employed in such service, by the same testimony which would be sufficient to prove that such vessel or person was employed in- the service of an acknowledged statel The seal of such acknowledged government cannot he permitted to prove itself; but it may be proved by some testimony as the nature of the case admits ; and the fact that such vessel or person is employed may be. proved without proving the seal.</p>\n<author id=\"b643-9\">Mr.. Justice Johnson.</author>\n<p id=\"AoF\">The first of these questions arises on the eonstrubtibn of the first division of the 8th section of the act for the punishment of certain crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"AzqB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>That act comprises two classes of cases, the second of which may again be subdivided into two divisions. In the -second class of cases, e.ach crime is specifically described in the ordinary mode of defining crimes, and so far the. constitutional power of defining and punishing, piracies and felonies on the high seas, is' strictly complied with. But, whh regard to the first class of cases, the legislature refers for a definition to other sources \u2014 to information not to be found in that section its\u00e9lf. The words are these : \u00a3\u00a3If any persons shall commit, upon the high seas, &amp;c. murder or robbery,, or ,any other offence, which, if committed in the body of a county, would, by the laws of the United States, be punishable with death, &amp;c. such person shall, upon conviction thereof, suffer death.\u201d Thus referring to the common law definition of murder and robbery alone, or to the common law definition of murder and robbery with the superadded statutory, requisite of being made punishable with death, if committed^on land, in order to\u00bbdefine the offence which, under that section, is made capitally punishable.</p>\n<p id=\"A8By\">The crime of robbery is the offence charged in this .indictment, and the question is, -whether it- must not be shown that it must have been made punishable with death, if committed on land, in order to subject the offender1 to that punishment, if committed on the high seas. And singular as it may appear, it really is the fact in this case,, that these mens\u2019 lives may depend upon a comma more or less, or upon the question whether a relative, which may take in three antecedents just as -well as one, shall he confined to one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>alone. Upon such a question I here solemny declare, that I never will consent to take the life of any man in obedience to any court; and if ever fore ed to choose between obeying this court, on such a point, or resigning my commission, I would not hesitate adopting the latter alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">But to my mind it is obvious, that both the intent of the legislature, and the construction of the words, are in favour of the prisoners. This, however, is more than I need contend for, since a doubt relative to that construction or intent ought to be as effectual in their favour, as the most thorough convicti\u00f3n.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">When the intent of the legislature is looked into, it is as obvious as the light, and requires as little reasoning to prove, its existence, that the object proposed was with regard to crimes which may be committed either \u25a0on the sea or land', to produce an uniformity in the punishment, so that where death was inflicted in the one case\u2019, it should be inflicted in another. And congress certainly legislated1 under the idea, that the pun* ishment of death had been previously enacted for. the crime of robbery pn laud, as it had in fact been , for murder, and some other crimes. And in my opinion* this intent ought to govern the grammatical construction, and make the relative to refer to ajl three of the antecedents, <em>murder, robbery, </em>and other <em>crimes, </em>instead of-being confined to the last alone. That it may be so applied consistently with grammatical correctness, no one can deny; and if so, <em>in favorem vite, </em>we are, in my opinion, legally bound to give it that construction. Again ; there, is no reason. to \u00bfthink that the word <em>other </em>is altogether a supernumerary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>member of the sentence. To give the construction contended for in behalf of the United States, that word mu\u00a7f be rendered useless and inoperative; the sentence has the same meaning with or without it. But if we retain it, and substitute.its. definition, or examine its effect upon the meaning of the terms associated with it, we then have the following results : <em>other </em>is commonly defined to mean <em>not the same, </em>or (what is certainly synonymous,)1 <em>not before </em>mentioned. With this expression, the sentence.would read thus : \u201cmurder, or robbery, or any offence not before mentioned,\u201d for which, the punishment of death is by law inflicted. And as the use of the comma is exceedingly arbitrary and indefiite, by expunging all the cominos from the Sentence the meaning becomes rtill more obvious. Or, if instead of subsisting the words not before mentioned, we introduce the single term <em>tin enumerated, </em>in the- sense of which the term <em>other </em>is unquestionably used by the legislature, the conclusion becomes irresistible in favour of.the prisoners. There is another view of this subject that leads to the same conclusion.; by supplying an obvious elision, the same'.meaning- is given to this section. The word <em>other </em>is responded to by <em>than, </em>and the repetition of the excluded words\u2019 is understood. Thus,in the case before us, by supplying the- elision, we \u201cmake murder, robbery,, or any crime other than murder or robbery,!\u2019 made punishable, &amp;c, the signification of which .words, had they been used, would have left no doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">There are several inconsistences growing out of a construction unfavourable to the prisoners, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>merit the. most serious consideration. The first is, the most sanguinary character that it gives to this law in its operation ; for it is literal!y true, that under it a whole ship\u2019s crew may.be consigned to the gallows, for robbing a vessel of a single chicken,\u25a0 even although a robbery committed on land for thousands, may not have been made punishable beyond whipping or confinement. If natural reason is not to be consulted on this point, at least the mild and benignant spirit of the laws of the United States merits attention. With regard to the mail'.this inconsistency actually, may occur under' existing laws, should the mail ever again be carried by water, as it Ibas, been formerly. This cannot be consistent with\u2019the intention of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\">But, it is contended, if congress had not intended, to make murder and robbery punishable with death,, independently of the circumstance of . those offences being so made punishable when committed on land} they would have omitted those specified crimes altogether from Ibis section, and have enacted generally^, that all crimes made . punishable with death on land should be.punishable with death if committed on .the seas, without enumerating murder and robbery.\u2014 This is fair reasoning; and in any case but one of life and death, it might have some weight.. But in no case, very great weight; because, in that respect, a legislature is subject to no laws in the selection of the course to be pursued. In this case, the obvious fact is, that they . commenced enumerating, and fearing some omission of crimes then supposed subject by law to. death,these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>general descriptive words are resorted to. But every other crime that' this division of. the section comprises was punishable with death, both these which precede robbery in the .enumeration., and those which come after. Robbery, except in case of the mail, stands alone; and, no doubt, was introduced under the idea, that that also had the same punishment attached to it. If it had not, in fact,, then it was the case on which the legislature intended to act; and according to my views of the grammatical or philological construction of the sentence, it. is one on which they have not acted.. This construction derives considerable force, also, from the consi deration that this act is framed on t he model of the British statute, which avowedly had' this uniformity for its object.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The second question proposed in this case is one on which, I presume;-Iher\u00e9 can be no1 doubt. For the definition of robbery under this act we must look for the definition, of the term, in the common law, or we will find it no where; and, according to my construction, superadd td tfctit definition the circumstance of its being made punishable With death, under, the laws of the United States, if commitfsd on land, and you have described the offence made punishable under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">There are eleven questions certified from the circuit court of Massachusetts; but of those eleven,. these two- only appear to me to arise offt of the case. The transcript contains nothing but the indictment and impannelling of the jury. No motion; no evidence; no demurrer <em>ore </em>tenus, or case stated, appears upon the transcript, on which the remaining questions could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>arise. On the indictment the two first questions might well have been raised by the court themselves',, as of counsel for the prisoners ; but as far as appears to this court,.all the other questions might as well have been raised in any other case; I here enter my protest against having these general questions adjourned to this court. We are constituted to decide causes, and not to discuss themes,- or digest systems. It is true, the words of the act, respecting division of opinion in the circuit court, are general; but independently of the con~ sideration that it was not to be expected' that the court could be divided, unless upon questions arising out of some cause depending, the words in the first proviso, \u201c that the cause may be proceeded in,\u201d plainly show that the questions contemplated in the act are questions arising in a cause depending-; and if so, it ought to be shown that they do arise in $Jie cause,. and are not merely hypothetical. In the case of Martin v. Hunter,<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> this court expressly acted upon this principle, when it went into a consideration of the questi\u00f3n, whether any estate existed in the plaintiff in error, before it would consider the question on the construction of the treaty, as applicable to that estatp.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\">If, however, it becomes necessary to consider the other questions in this case, I will lay down a few general principles, whith, I believe, will answer all : 1. Con gress can inflict punishment on offences committed (jii board the vessels of $he United States, or by citizens of the United States, any where ; but congress cannot make that piracy which \u00cd3 not piracy by the law \u00aef ha* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>lions, in order to give jurisdiction to its own courts over such offences.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq1I\">2. When open war exists between a nation and its subjects, the subjects of the revolted country are no-^010 ]ja^]e j0 be punished as pirates, than the subjects \u25a0 Who adhere to their allegiance; and whatever .immunity the law of nations'gives to the ship, it extends to atf who serve <em>on </em>board of her, excepting duly the responsibility of individuals to the laws of their respective .countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">3. The proof of a commission is not necessary to exempt an individual serving on board a ship engaged in the war, because any ship rtf a belligerent may capture an enemy ; and whether acting under a commission or not, is an immaterial question as to third persons: he must answer that to his own government. Ttis only necessaty to prove two-'facts.: 1st. The existence of open war: 2dly. That the vessel is really documented, owned, and commanded as a belligerent vessel, and not affectedly so for .piratical purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">. 4. For proof of property and documents, it is not to be expected that any.better evidence can be produced \u2022than the seal of the revoltecbcountry, with such reasonable evidence as the case may admit of, to prove it to be known as such; and a seal once proved, or admitted to a court, ought afterwards to be acknowledged by the court officially, at least, as qgainst the party who has once acknowledged it.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Certificate. \u2014 This' cause\u25a0 came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the circuit court of -the United- States, for the district of Massachusetts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>on the questions on which the judges of that court were divided; and was argued by counselon the part of the United States. On consideration whereof, this court is of opinion that a robbery committed on the high seas,- although such robbery, if comm'itted on land, would not, by the laws of the United States, be punishable with death, Is piracy under the eighth section .of an act entitled, \"an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States;\u201d and that the circuit courts of the United States have jurisdiction thereof. And that the crime of robbery, as mentioned in +he said act of congress, is the crime of robbery ns recognized and defined at cummonlaw</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">This court is further of opinion, that the crime o\u00ed robbery, committed by a person on the high seas, on board of any ship or vessel belonging exclusively to subjects of a foreign state, on persons within a vessel belonging exclusively to subjects of a foreign state, is not piracy within the true intent and meaning of the act, entitled, \"an act for the punishment of certain crimes against-the Uuited States,\u201d and is not punishable in the courts of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">This court is further of opinion, that when a civil war rages in a foreign nation, one part of which separates itself from the old established government' and erects itself into a distinct government, the courts of the union must view such newly constituted government as it is viewed by the legislative and executive departments of the government of the United States. If the government of the union remains neutral, but recognizes the existence of a civil war, the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>of the union cannot consider as criminal those acts of hostility, .which war authorizes, and which the new government may direct against its enemy. In general, the same testimony which would be sufficient to prove that a vessel or a person is in me service of an acknowledged state, must be admitted to prove t\u00fcat a vessel or person is in the service of such newly erected government. Its seal cannot be allowed to prove itself, but may be proved by such testimony as the nature of the case admits. And the fact that a <em>ves~ </em>sel or person is in me service of such government may be established otherwise, should it be impraetic\u00e1ble to prove the seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">All which is ordered to be ' certified to the circuit court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts.</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><em> 7 Cranch, </em>603. <em>Ante, </em>vol. 1, p. 304.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>", "html_with_citations": "", "extracted_by_ocr": true, "opinions_cited": []}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/8373756/", "id": 8373756, "absolute_url": "/opinion/8403413/the-neptune/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/8403413/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2022-10-17T19:25:16.160046-07:00", "date_modified": "2022-10-17T19:25:16.160061-07:00", "author_str": "Duvall", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "020lead", "sha1": "", "page_count": null, "download_url": null, "local_path": null, "plain_text": "", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "<opinion type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A-U\">Mr. Justice Duvall</author>\n<p id=\"AYZ\">delivered the opinion of the court. The ship Neptune, owned and commanded by-Captain Myrick, arrived at New-Orleans from. London on the 20th of October, 1815. On the next day he appeared, in company with George M. Ogden, one of the appellants, at the custom house, an&lt;\u00bf reported the Neptune as a registered vessel of the United States, belonging to. Wilmington North Carolina, where, he alleged, and it was so stated in the manifest, she was registered. He declared, at the same, .time, that he had lost the register in ascending the Mississippi, and required \u00e1 new one to be issued'in lieu of it. Capta.in Myrick had made a protest before a notary public to that effect, and offered to tqke the oath required by the 13ths section-of the act, entitled, an act 'concerning the <em>registering and recording of </em>ships or vessels, but was taken sick, and, in a few days afterwards, died without taking it.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\">George M. Ogden administered on the estate 'of Captain Myrick, * and on the 22d of November, the court of probates ordered -a sale of the effects <em>of the </em>intestate, which was made on the 5th of December following, at which sale Messrs. Harrod and Ogdens became the purchasers of the Neptune, for 7,500 dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">On the. 12th of January, 1816, Messrs. Harrod and Ogdens addressed a letter to the collector, requesting to be informed whether a register could be granted for the ship Neptune, on the owner\u00ae taking the \u25a0 oath prescribed by law. The coll\u00e9e\u00edor replied, by letter dated the 20th, that a register had been refused the ship Neptune, on the ground that.the oath: offered, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>show the loss of a former register was insufficient, inasmuch as it contained an assertion that the register lost was granted at the port of Wilmington in North Carolina, and by a letter from the collector of that \u2022' port, information had been received that no such regis, ter was ever issued from his office. The collector was afterwards examined as a witness in the cause, and declared on oath to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\">George M. Ogd.en, one of the owners, afterwards applied at the collector\u2019s office for a register, offering to take ah oath, the form of which he had prepared, varying from the form of the oath required by law; he was- informed by the collector it was not sufficient, and that unless he would take the oath in the .form prescribed by the registry act, a register could not be granted. Mr. Ogden pressed the form of the oath which he had tendered, -but was again fold it c .'Jd not be received. Mr. Ogden had been shown n'e letter from the collector at Wilmington, and had been informed of its contents by the attorney for the, district. Nevertheless, he appeared in the collectors\u2019s. office on the 22d of January, 1816, and took the oath required by law, relying, as he said, bn the oath which Captain Myrick had taken, as the ground of his oath ; and a register issued in form to the owners, Richard Peniston, master. In 'this oath he deposed, that \u201cbeing owner in part and having charge of the ship or Vessel called the Neptune, the said ship or vessel had been, as he verily believed, registered according to law by the name-of Neptune, and that a certificate thereof was granted by the collector of the district of Wilmington in the state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>North Carolina, which certificate had been lost .and destroyed by accidentally falling overboard in the river Mississippi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">On the part of the owners, John M\u2019Cauley, mate of the Neptune, deposed, that on her voyage from London to New-Ofleans, he had seen the register of the ship Neptune frequently, and before the issuing .of the new register ne had assured Mr. Ogden he had seen it, and that he. believed it to be dated at Wilmington, North ^Carolina, and that it was lost, by ^accident, from the pocket of' the captain in the river Mississippi; and that he had no reason to doubt it a genuine one. M\u2019Cauley being asked, \u201cDid - captain^ Myrxck <em>tell </em>you on his return from town that he had shown the register' to Messrs. Harrod and Ogdens 1 answered, he fiad laid the pocket book containing it on the desk. The carpenters, who repaired the Neptune, certified that in their opinion, she was built \u25a0in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"AABA\">The Neptune .cleared out at the custom house of New-Orleans, on the 9th day of February, 1816, when she was immediately seized by the collector, as .forfeited to the United States, and lib.elled for a breach of the 27th section of the act of congress of the 31st of December, 1792, cb. 146. (I.) entitled, \u201cAn act concerning the registering and recording of ships or vessels.\u201d Upon these facts, the Neptune together with .her tackle, apparel and furniture, was, by \u25a0 the sentence of the district court, condemned as forfeited to the United States. From this decree the owners appealed to-this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The question for the decision of this court must depend upon the true construction of the act before mentioned. If the appellants have, in all respects, complied with the requisites of that act, they have incurred no forfeiture; if any of its provisions,- which inflict a forfeiture of the vessel for a noil-compliance, have been violated, a forfeiture will ensue.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\">By the first section of the act, it is provided, that ships or vessels of the United States shall not continue to enjoy the benefits and privileges appertaining to such ships or vessels, longer than they shall continue to be wholly owned, and be commanded by a citizen, or citizens, of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"Abaq\">The third section directs that all vessels, thereafter to be registered, shall be registered by the collecter of the district, in which shall be comprehended the port to which the ship or vessel shall belong at the time of her registry; which port shall be deemed to be that at' or nearest to which the owner, if there be but one, or if more than one, the husband or acting and managing owner, of such ship or vessel usually resides; and the name of the vessel, and of the port to which she be*longs, shall be painted on her stern.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The fourt section prescribes the substance of ths. oath to be taken in order to the registry, and contains a clause of forfeiture, in case any of the matters of fact, which shall be within the knowledge of the party swearing, shall not be true. The fifth section makes it the duty of all the owners resident within the United States, to take.a like oath within ninety days after the granting the register.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The ninth section directs the collector, of each district to keep a record of all ships and vessels to which registers shall have- been granted, and prescribes the form of the register. The tenth section directs a copy-of each register tobe transmitted to the .register-of the treasury, who shall cause a recoid of them to be kept.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The eleventh section directs the course of proceeding, in case a vessel'be purchased by a citizen'before registry, and contains a clause of forfeiture in case of false swearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">By the thirteenth section it is enacted, ithat if the . certificate of registry of any vessel shall -be lost, destroyed, or mislaid, the master, or other person having, the charge or command of her, may make oath, or-affirmation, before the collector of the district, where such vessel shall first be, after Such loss or destruction; and the form of the' oath is prescribed. It is an. essential part of the oath', that in it shall be stated the name, oftthe collector,'and the port at which the former register was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The fourteenth section requires, that when a registered vessel shall be sold or transferred to a citizen of the United States, she shall be registered anew by her former name; and if not registered anew, she shall not be entitled to the privilege's or benefits, of a ship of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">By the twenty-seventh section it is provided, that if any certificate of registry or record shall be fraudulently, or lcnowdngly, used for any ship or vessel not then actually entitled to the benefit thereof, according' to the true intent of the act, such ship or vessel shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>be forfeited to the United States, with her tackle, ap. parel^ and furniture. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">In the argument of this case it was admitted by the counsel for the appellants, that the register was improperly obtained, but it was denied that the vessel became thereby forfeited under' the 27th, or any other section of the registry act. And it was contended that th\u00e9 owner having a register issued <em>by </em>the collector, was proof that\u2019 it was not fraudulently obtained. In support of this position, the case of the Anthony Mangin was cited from 3 Cranch\u2022 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">To this it was replied, that the appellants purchased the Neptune knowing that she was without.a register. \u2022 That it was alleged to have been granted to the former owner by the collector for the port of Wilmington\u00bb jn North Carolina, and that it was lost. The appellants knew that information had been received from the collector at \"Wilmington, that a register for the Neptune had never been issued at that port;. and that, therefore,, it was fraudulently obtained, and used for the Neptune, not then entitled to the benefit of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The case of the Anthony Mangin does not support the argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel. In that case an action was brought by the United States against Grundy and Thornburgh, for money had and received for the use of the United States by the de~ fendants, as assignees of Aquila Brown, junior, a bankrupt, it being money received by the defendants for the sale of the ship Anthony Mangin, \u2022which ship the United States alleged was forfeited by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>reason that Brown, in order to obtain a register for her as a ship of the United States, had falsely sworn that she was his <em>sole </em>property, when he' knew that she was in part owned by an alien. There was no proceeding <em>in rem </em>against the vessel. It was a suit against the assignees of JBrown for the value of the vessel ; and the court decided that an action for the value could only be supported against the person who had taken the oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\">It is evident from the facts in this case, that George M. Ogden,-when he applied for a register for the Neptune, did not believe that he could with safety take the oath required by law; because he had prepared an path varying in form from the oath required, which he pressed the collector to he permitted to take, hut which the collector refused to administer. And the collector was of opinion, until he consulted the district attorney, that he ought not to he -permitted to take the oath prescribed, as he could not do it without swearing to a fact which was knowrn to be untrue. For this reason he refused to admir ister the oath <em>to </em>Captain Myrick in his life time.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">There are' strong grounds for the belief that the Neptune never had a genuine register. She is represented in the manifest to have been built at Boston\u2014 to be owned by Captain Myrick of New-York \u2014 and that she belonged to the port of Wilmington, in North Carolina. If she had been built at Boston, and belonged at the time to a person residingin New-York, it is more than probable that, pursuant to the provisions of the third section of the act, she would have been registered at one of those places. If Captain Myrick or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>tbfe present owners had been desirous of obtaining correct information .on the subject, it would have been furnished on application to the treasury depart\"' ment. A'l registers are transmitted regularly to the register of the treasury to be registered in his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\">It should be recolleclecf, that the mate of the Neptune testified, that Captain Myrick, after returning from the house of Messrs. IHarrod and Ogdens to his vessel said he had left his pocket-book containing the register on \u00a1stheir\u2019 desk. Hence, it is rational to Conclude, either that Captain Myrick had no-register, or that if he had one, it would not Lear inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Upon the^whole, the court are of opinion that the register was fraudulently and knowningly used for the Neptune, when she was not entitled to the benefit of it; and that she is forfeited for a violation of the provisions of the 27th section of the registry act ; and that the provisions of that section apply as well to vessels which have not-iJEf\u00e9n previously registered, as to those to which registers have been pr eviously granted. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Decree amrmea-</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Decree. \u2014 This caus\u00e9 enme on to be heard on the transcript of the record, and was argued by counsel.

Hemptonstrall one of the company, took possession of his field notes,' after his d\u00e9ath, and lodged them in Preston\u2019s office; and that it was Taylor\u2019s usual practice to mark all the corners, of his.surveys.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\">The correctness of the decree made in this caus\u00e9 is objected to on various grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">1st. Because it does not appear that .Hancock Taylor had in his possession, or under his. control, a warrant, authorizing him to execute this survey for William Sutherland'.</p>\n<p id=\"AIsq\">2d. Because there is not only an \u00e1bsence of all evidence to prove that the survey,.fo.r Sutherland, \u00abwas made and completed on the ground, but-that it appears,-from tjhe evidence of'Hemptonstrall, that no such survey was actually made. This witness states, that he attended Hancock Taylor; on this survey as a marker, and sometimes as a chain carrier. He <em>proves the </em>beginning corner, and the five first lines of the survey ending at four chesnut*trees, the mark \u00f3f which 'lines were plainly discernable when this tract was surveyed under an ord\u00e9r of the circuit court made, in this cause. But he adds, that the subsequent lines of the survey were not run; and the. surveyor who.executed the order of the circuit court reports, that he met with no marked: line, or corner trees, after he left the four chesn.uts.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Xl\">3d. It.is objected, in the third place, that the sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>rey, not having been'completed by the deputy survey- or, the court ought to infer that the lines actually run were- merely experimental.; arid, in such a case, it is contended, that'the principal surveyor could not make, and certify a plat of the survey on which a grant .could legally be founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\">It appears to the court, that these objections were fully examined and overruled in the case of Taylor and Quarles v. Brown, 5 Cranch, 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">It Was there, decided, 1. That if in pc.nt of law, the warrant must be lodged in' the office of the surveyor at the time when the survey is made, his certificate, which states that the survey was made by virtue of the governor\u2019s warrant, and agreeably to his majesty\u2019s rnyal proclamation of 1.763, is sufficient evidence that the warrant was in his possession at that time. In this case the warrant, under which Sutherland\u2019s\u00bb survey was made, is described in the certificate with sufficient certainty-fo\u25a0 nroye .that the officer in making--the survey acted under its authority. 2. It was decided that' the 6th section of the act of Virginia, passed in the ye.ar 1748, entitled, \u201c an act directing the duty of surveyors of lands,\u201d upon which the second obiection made in 1hnt case, and in this, is founded, is merely directory to the nffirer. and that if does not inake the validity of the survey to denend upon the conformity bf the officer-to its requisitions. This consrrucuon of the above section appears to the. court to he perfectly well founded. The ownfcr -of the warrant has no pouter to control the conduct of the surveyor, whose duty it is to execute it, and\u2019 it would .therefore be \u2022 unreasonable to deprive him \u25a0 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the title which the warrant confers upon, him, on account of the ' subsequent, neglect of that officer. I . the .omission of the surveyor to \u201c see the land plainly bounded ,by natural. bounds or marked trees,\u201d which the law imposes upon him as a duty, cannot af? feet the title of the warrant holder,, it Would follow that his omission Jo run all the lihes of the survey on the ground, which the\u2019law does not in express 'terms require' him to do', ought not. to \u25a0 produce Jhat effect. If the surveyor, by running some of tbe.lines? and from adjoining surveys, natural boundaries,,or his personal knowledge of the ground, is enabled to protract th\u00e9. remaining linqs, so as to close the survey, no subseqtrent locator Can impeach the title founded upon such survey, upon the ground that all the lines were not run arid marked. The legislature may undoubtedly declare all such surveys to be void ; but no statute .to this effect was in force in Virginia at the time when this- survey .was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">3. The third objection made to this decree appears to be substantially removed by the opinion of this court-on the third point.in the c\u00e1se above referred to. If was there decided that the survey, though in fact made by the deputy surveyor, was in point of law to be considered as made by the principal, and, consequeritly, that his signature to the plat and certificate was a sufficient . authentication of the suryey to entitle the person claiming under it to a grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">As to the distinction taken at the bar'between that case and this, upon the ground that in this the sur- . vey was merely experimental, and was not intended to be made in execution of the warrant, there is cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>t&amp;iniy nothing in it. It is by acts that the intention of men, in. the absence o.f positive declarations, can , best be discovered. The survey made by Taylor was adopted by .the principal surveyor, as one actually done in execution , of the warrant to Sutherland,, and it would be too much for this; or any other court, to presume that a contrary intention prevailed in the mind eith'er-of'the' principal or deputy surveyor^ and on that supposition .to pronounce the survey invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\">The last objection made to this decree is, that as a\" British subject, Wm. Sutherland could not take a legal title to this land under the state of Virginia, and,consequently, that the grant to him in 1788 was void,arid was not protected'by. the treaty of 1794, between the United States and Great Britain.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The decision of this court in the case of Fairfax\u2019s devisee v. Hunter\u2019s lessee, (7 <em>Cranch, </em>603.) affords a full answer to this objection- \u25a0 In that case .the will of Lord Fairfax took effect in the year 1781, during the war, and Denny Martin, the 'devisee/ under that will, was found to be a native born British subject, who had never become a citizen of any. of the United States, but had always resided ' in England..</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\u25a0 It was ruled in that case, 1st. . That although the devisee.was an <em>cm alien enemy </em>at the time of the testa^ tor\u2019s death, yet_he took an estate in fee under the will, which could npt, on the ground of alienage, be devested but by inquest of office, or by some legislative - act equivalent thereto. 2d\u201e That the defeasible title thus vested i-n. the alien devisee was complete<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>ly protected and confirmed.by the ninth article <em>ot </em>treaty of 1794.</p>\n<p id=\"AAQ\">These principles are decisive of the objection now under consideration. In that cuse,.as in this,, the lei gal title vested in the alien by purchase during the war, and was not devested by any act of Virginia, pri- or to the treaty o\u00a31794, which rendered their estates absolute and indefeasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Decree affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>", "html_with_citations": "", "extracted_by_ocr": true, "opinions_cited": []}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/8373753/", "id": 8373753, "absolute_url": "/opinion/8403410/cameron-v-mroberts/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/8403410/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2022-10-17T19:25:16.024137-07:00", "date_modified": "2022-10-17T19:25:16.024150-07:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "020lead", "sha1": "", "page_count": null, "download_url": null, "local_path": null, "plain_text": "", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "<opinion type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Geetiexcate.

The common sense of mankind would determine, that a devise of moriey, the proceeds of land directed to be sold, isa devise of money, notwithstanding it is to arise^ out of land; and that a devise of land, which a testator by his will directs to be ( purchased,, will pass an interest in the land jtself, without regard to the -character of the fund out jf which the p\u00farchase is to be made,.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The settled doctrine of the courts of equity corres1 <em>J </em>pond with this obvious construction of wills, as as of other 'instruments, whereby land is directed to be turned into money, or money into land, for benefit of those for whose use the conversion is ded to be made. In the case of Fletcher v. Ashburner, (1 Bro. <em>Ch. Cas. 497.) </em>the master of the rolls says, that \u201cnothing is \u2019 better established than this principle, that money directed to be employed in the purchase of land, and land directed to be sold and turned into money, are to be considered as that species^ of property into which they are'directed to be converted, and this, in whatever manner the direction is given.\u201d He adds, \u201cthe owner of the fund, or the contracting parties,' may make land money, or money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u00a1and. The eases establish this rule' universally.** This declaration is well warranted by the cases to\u00bb which the master of the rolls refers, as well as by many others. (See Dougherty v. Bull, 2 <em>P. Wms. </em>320. Yeates v. Comptan, Id. 358. Trelawney v. Booth, 2 Atk. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The principle upon which the whole of this doctrine is founded is, that a-court of equity, regarding the substance, and not the mere forms and circumstances of agreements and other instruments, considers things directed or agreed to-be done, as having been actually performed, where nothing has intervened which ought t\u00f3 prevent a performance. This qualification of. the more concise and general rule, that equity considers that to be done which is agreed to' be- done, will comprehend the cases which coia\u00a1e under this head of eTli{D</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Thus, where the whole beneficial interest in the mo- . . . , ney in the one case, or in the land m the other, belongs to the person for whose use it is given, a court of equity will not compel the trustee to execute the -trust' against the wishes of the <em>cestuy que trust, </em>but will per-n _ <em>.si </em>mit him to'take the money or the \u25a0 land, if he elect to\" do so before .the conversion has' actually been made : this election he may make, as well by acts or dec\" c^earty indicating \u00e1 d termination to that effeet,-'as by application to a court of equity. It is this election, and not the mere right to make it, which changes the character of the estate so as to make it real or personal, at the will of the party entitled to the beneficial interest.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AA5\">BUt \u00a1jf\u00e9\u00ab\u00a1J^^his eUc* tion, the pro-to^ls \u2022 ifeirs' \u201c in the same manner as .it would have done &gt;1 the con, version had</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">time. If this election be not made in time to stamp the property with a character different from that which the will or other instrument gives it, the latter accompanies it, with all its legal consequences, into the hands of those entitled to it in that character. So that in case of the death of the <em>cestuy que trust, </em>out having determined his election, the property, will pass to his heirs or personal representatives, in the same manner as it would have done had the trust been executed, and the .conversion actually made in his life</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">In the case of Kirkman v. Mills, (13 <em>Ves.) </em>which was a devise of real estate to trustees %npon trust to sell,'and the'moneys arising, as well as the rents profits till the sale, tobe equally divided between the testators, three daughters, A. B. and C.' The estate' was, upon the death of A. B. and C., considered and treated as personal property, notwithstanding the <em>jcestuy que trusts, </em>after the death of the testator, had entered upon, and occupied the land for about twro years prior to their deaths; but no steps had been taken by them, or by the trustees, to sell, nor had any requisition to that-effect been made by the former to the latter. The master of the rolls was of opinion that the occupation of the land for two years was too short to presume an election. He adds, \u201cthe opinion of Lord R\u00f3sslyn, that property was to be taken as it happened to be at the death of the party frorp whom the representative claims, had been much doubted by Lord Eldon, who held, that without some act, it must be considered as be.ing in the state in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>which it ought to be; and that Lord Rosslyn\u2019s rul\u00e9 was new, and not according to the prior cases,</p>\n<headnotes id=\"A4lE\">'The case of Roper v.

Wms. </em>171.) which was a covenant on marriage to invest 10,000Z., part ofthe lady\u2019s fortune, in the pur . .chase of land in fee, to be settled on the husband fo life, remainder to his first and every other son in <em>tai </em>male, remainder to the husband in fee. The only-son of this marriage having died without issue, and 'in testate, and the investment ofthe money not having been made during his life, the chancellor decided that the money passed to the heir at law ; tha,t it was in the election of the son to have made this, money, or to \"have disposed of it as such, and that, therefore, even his parol disposition of it would have been regarded <em>i </em>but that something to determine the election must be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">This doctrine, so veil established by the cases which have been referred to, and by many others' which it is unnecessary to mention, seems to be' conclu . \u25a0 . ,. , . , ,, . . . ., , sive Upon the question which this court is called upon decide, and would render any farther investigation ofit useless, .were it not for the case of Roper v. Radcliffe, which was cited, and mainly relied upon, the counsel for the state of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">The short statement of that case' is as follows j John Roper conveyed all his lands to trustees and their heirs, in trust, to sell the same, and out ofthe proceeds, and of the rents and profits till sale, to pay certain debts, and the overplus of the money to be paid as he, the said John Roper, by his will or other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>wise should appoint, and for want of such appointment for the benefit of the said John Roper, and his hqiisBy. his will reciting, the said deed, and the power reserved to him in the surplus of the said real estate, he ,bequeathed several pecuniary legacies, and then gave the residue of his <em>real </em>and personal est te to William Constable and Thomas Radcliffe, and two. o./iers, arid to their heirs. By a codicil to this will, he bequeathed other-pecuniary legacies; and the remainder,'whether in <em>lands </em>or personal estate,- he gave to the .said. W. C\u2018 and T. R.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\">Upon a bill filed by W. C. and T. R. against the heir at law of John Roper, and -the other trustees, praying to have the'trust executed, and the residue of the money arising from the sale-of the'.lands to be paid over to them ; the heir at law opposed the execution tpf the trust, and claimed the land as a resulting trust,* upon the ground of the incapacity of*Constable and Radcliffe to take; th\u00e9y being papists. The decr\u00e9e-of ,the court of chancery, -which was in favour of the papists, was, upon appeal to the house of lords, reversed' and the title of the heir at law sustained; six judges against five, being in his favour.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Without stating at large the opinion upon which the reversal took place, this court will proceed, 1st; To examine thu general principles laid down in that'opinion ; and then, 2d. The case itself, so far as it has been' pressed upon us as an authority .to rule the question be \u2022 fore the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In performing the first part of this undertaking, it will not be necessary to' question any one of the premises laid down. in that opinion. They are, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>1. That land devised to trustees, to sell for payment of debts and legacies, is to be deemed as money. ThA is the general doctrine established by all the-cases referred to in the preceding part of this opinion. That the heir at law has a resulting trust in such so fair as it is of value, after the debts and lega- ; <em>7 </em>. . c\u00edes are paid, and that he may come into equity and restrain -the trustee from selling more than is neces- *\u00b0 Pay'Uie debt and legacies ; or he may offer to them himself, and pray to have a conveyance of <em>J </em>. , ,. part of the land not. sold in the first case, and th\u00ae whole in the latter, which property will, in either case\u00bb1 land, and not money. This right to call for a conveyance velT correctly styled a privilege, and it one which a court of equity will never refuse, unless ' there are strong reasons for refusing it. The this doctrine, proceeds upon a principle is incontrovertible, that w'here the testator 5 merely directs the real estate to be converted into ' , . , money, for the purposes directed in his will, so much \u00b0f the estate, or the money arising from it, as .is not efEectually disposed of by the will, (whether it arise from some omission or defect in the will ilself, or . from any subsequent accident, which prevents the devise from taking effect,) results to the heir at law, as the old use not disnosed of. Such was the case of Crewe v. Bailey, (3 <em>P. Wms. 20.) </em>where the testator having two sons, A. and B. Qand three daughters, devised his lands to be. sold to pay his debts, &amp;c. and as to the moneys arising by the sale, after debts paid, gave JB200 to A. the eldest son, <em>at the age of </em>21, and ^he fesidue to bis four younger children. A. died be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>fore the age of 21, in consequence of which, the bequest to him failed to take, ^effect. The court decided that the <em>\u00a3200 </em>should be considered as land to descend to the heir at law of the testator, because it was in effect, the s\u00e1me as if so much land as was of the value of ,\u00a3200 was not directed to be sold, but was sufferred to descend. The, case of Ackroyd v. Smithson, (1 <em>Bro Ch. Cas. </em>503.) is one of the same kind, and .establishes the same principle. So, likewise, a money provision under, a marriage con-' tract, to arise out of land, which did not take effect,, on account of the death of the party for whose benefit it was intended, before the time prescribed, resulted as money to the grantor, so 'as to pass under a residuary clause in his will. (Hewitt v. Wright, 1 <em>Bro. Ch. Cas. </em>86.).</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AvY\"><em>Land </em>\u00ab1 to to sell for payment of debts to Adeemed</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"AqHv\">law has a suiting trust such lands, and legacies may com'e into \u25a0Sihithetrus\" tee from sulkcient to nwy^offer pay them self, and pray a conveyance of the part of the land not qpse^'and ^tlfe latter which property in either case will be Zand and not <em>money.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"ArDH\">\u00b0te\u00bb appears to harfljpeeii to stamp upon oMh/ianTd? ly&lt;)f persunai ty,not only/or particular IvM^but toaU ^aim S\u2019of the-at trtStt.- is deestate\u2019is cons? persona\u00ed!* be</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">But even in cases of resulting trusts, for the fit of the heir at law, it is settled that if the . of the testator appears to have been to stamp upon the proceeds of the land described to be sold, the quality of personalty, not only to subserve the ticular purposes of the will, but to all intents, the r r \u2019 claim of the heir at law to a resulting trust is ed, and the estate is considered to be personal. This was decided in the case of Yeates v. Compton, (2 P. <em>Wms. </em>308.) in which the chancellor says, that intention of, the will was to give away all from the heir, and to turn the land into personal estate, and that this was to be taken as it was at the testator\u2019S death, and ought not to be altered by any subsequent accident, and decreed the heir to join in the sale \u2022f. the \u2022 land, and the money. arising therefrom to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>paid over as personal estate to the representatives of the annuitant, and to those of the- residuary legatee. In. She case of Fletcher v. Ashburner, before referred to, the -suit was brought by the he.ir at law- of the. testator, against the personal representatives and the trustees claiming the estate upon the ground of a resulting trust. But.the court decreed the property, as money, to the personal representatives of him- to \u2022 whom the beneficial interest in the money was bequeathed, and the master of the rolls observes, that the cases of Emblyn v. Freeman, and Crewe v. Bailey are those where real estate being directed to be sold, some part of .the disposition has failed, and the thing devised has not accrued to the representative, or d\u00e9visee, by which something- has re-&gt; suited to the heir at law.</p>\n<p id=\"AyE\">\u25a0' It is evident, therefore, from a view of the above bases, that the title of the heir to a resulting trust can never arise, except when something is left undisposed of, either by some defect in the will, or by some subsequent lapse, which prevents the devise from taking effect; and not even then,-, if it appears that-the in-. tent-ion of the. testator wa's' to change the nature of the estate from land to money, absolutely and entirely, and not merely to serve the purposes of the will. But the ground upon which the title of the heir rests is, that whatever is not disposed of remains to him, and partakes of the o'ld use, as if it had not been directed to.be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">The third proposition laid down in the case of Roper v. Radcliffe, is, that equity will extend, the same privilege to <em>the residr.ary legatee </em>which is allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>to the heir, to pay the debts and legacies, and call for a conveyance of the real estate, or to restrain the.trustees from selling more than is necessary to pay ihe debts and legacies.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"Aah_\">Equity will extend the toThe re'sTduawhich\u2019i^f\u00ed\u00edow ofiegacies, conveyance of ni&lt;&gt;r\u00ae than i\u00bb necessary *6 pay the debts 1\u00aes't&lt;a\u00aes'</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"AFD\">\u25a0. The condu^ed from**the thJtrin\u00a1c^ respect to th* residuary lega tee such a do cimWered as <em>soecjjklegatees</em></headnotes>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">This has, in effect, been admitted in the preceding part of this opinion; because if the <em>cestui que trust, of the whole </em>beneficial interest in the mopey to- arise trom the sale of the land, may claim this privilege, it follows, necessarily, that the residuary legatee because he is,, in effect,, the beneficial' owner the whole, charged with'the 'debts and legacies., from which he will be permitted to discharge it, by ing the debts and legacies, or may claim so much the real estate as-may not be necessary for that pur- \u2022 pose.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">But the court cannot accede to the which, in. Roper v. Radcliffe, is deduced from the establishraent of the above principles. That sion is, that in respect to the residuary legatee, such a devise shall be deemed <em>as land </em>in equity, though in respect to the <em>creditors </em>and <em>specific legatees </em>it is . , \u2022 , , . \u2022 de&amp;med as money. It. is admitted, with this qualm. c\u00e1lion, that, if the residuary legatee thinks proper to avail himself of the privilege of taking it as land, by f\u00e1akihg an election in his life time, the property will then assume the character of land. But. if. he does li\u00f3t m\u00e1te this election, the property .retains its racter of personalty to every intent and purpose. \u2014 The cases before cite'd seem to the court to be'conclusive Xtpon this point; and none were referred to, or have come under the view of the court, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>sanction the conclusion made m the unqualified terms. used in the case of Roper v. Radcliffe.</p>\n<p id=\"A_S\">Aa to the idea that the \u2019character of the estate is affected by this <em>right of election </em>whether the right be claimed, or not, it appears to -be as repugnant to reason, as we think it has. been shown to be, to principle and authorities. .Before any thing can be made of the proposition, it. should be shown that this right or privilege of election is so indissolubly united with the devise, hs to constitute a part of it, and that it may be exercised in all_ cases, and under all circumstances.\u2014 This was, indeed contended for with great ingenuity and abilities by the counsel for the state of Virginia, blit it was not proved <em>io </em>the satisfaction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">It certainly is not true, that equity will extend this privilege in all cases to the <em>cestui que trust </em>It will be refused if, he be an infant. In the case of Seely v. Jago, (1 P. <em>Wms. </em>389,) where money, was devised to belaid out inlandnn fee, to be s\u00e9ttledJon'A. B. and C. and . their heirs, equally to be divided;. On the death of A., his infant heir, together with B. and C., filed their, bill claiming to . have the money, which was decreed accordingly as to B. and C.; .but the share of the infant was ordered to be puf out for: his benefit,, and the reason .assigned was, that he was <em>incapable if marking an election, </em>and that such election, if permitted, would, in case of his death, be prejudicial. to his heir.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">In the case of Foone v. Blount, (Cowp. 467.) ItOjd Mansfield,.who is-compelled to acknowledge-the authority of Roper v. Radcliffe in parallel cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>combats the reasoning of Chief. Justice Parker upon this doctrine of election, with irresistible force. He suggests, as the true answer to it, that though in a variety of cases this right exists, yet it was inapplicable to the case of a person who was disabled by law from taking land, and that therefore a court of equity would, in such a case, decree that he should take \u00bfhe property as .money.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The case of Walker v. Denne, (2 Ves. Jun. 170.) seems to apply with great force to this part of our subject. The testator directed money tobe laid out in lands, tenements, and hereditaments, <em>or on long terms, </em>with limitations applicable to real estate. The money not having been laid out, the crown, on failure of heirs, claimed the moneyas land. It was decided that the crown had no equity against the next of kin to have the money laid out in real estate in order to claim it by escheat. It was added, that the devisees, oh becoming absolutely entitled, have the option given by the will'; and a d\u00e9ed of appointment by one of the <em>cestui que trusts, </em>though <em>nfeme covert, </em>was held a sufficient indication of her intention that it should continue personal, against her-heir claiming it as ineffectually disposed of for want of her examination. This case is peculiarly strong, from the circumstance, that the electtion is embodied in the devise itself; but this was \u2022not enough, because the crown had no equity to force an election to be made for the purpose of producing an escheat.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Equity would surely proceed contrary, to its regular course, and . the principles which universally govern U, to allow the right of election where <em>it is dt</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>sired, </em>and can be <em>lawfully made, </em>and yet- refuse to decree the money upon the application of the-alien, upon no other reason, but because, by law, he is'incapable to hold, the land; in short, to consider Kim in the same situation as if he had made an election, -which would have been refused had he asked for a conveyance. The more just and correct rule would seem to be, -that where the <em>cestui que trust </em>is incapable to take or t\u00f3 hold the land beneficially, the .right of election does not Nexist, and., consequently, that the property is- to be considered as being -of that species into which it is directed tobe .concerted.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AFQY\">'The case of dfffiT V\"distin \u2022\u201c** An; wen may <em>lake, </em>by pur chase, a free hold, or other interest in land and may <em>hold </em>it -against all the world excep the king; and even - against him until office found; and is not accounta ble for . the rents and pro fits previously received.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Having made these observations upon the principles laid down in the case of Roper v. Radcliffe, and upon the argument urged at the bar in support, of them, very few words will suffice to show that, as an authority, it.-is'inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AYL\">The incapacities of a papist under the English statute <em>di </em>11 and <em>Wm. </em>III. c. 4, and of an alien .at *aw&gt; are extremely dissimilar. ^ The former is incapable to take by purchase, any lands, or profits out of lands ; and all estates, terms, and any other <em>in? \u25a0forests ox profits </em>whatsoever out of lands, to by, mac/e, Suffered, or done, to, or for th\u00e9 use of such person? or upon any. trust for him., or to, or for the benefit, or, relief.of any such person,^are declared by the statute, to be utterly void.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Thus, it appears' that he cannot even <em>take. </em>His. incapacity is not copfinert to- land, b.u.t. to any profit, interest, benefit, or relief,\"in or out .of it. He is not |p?ly disabled .ftom..takiqg.. csr. haying the benefit ofiany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Such interest, but the will or deed itself,. which attempts to pass it, is void. Iii. Roper v. Radcliffe, it was strongly insisted, thrft the money given to the papistj which was to be the proceeds of the-land, was a Drofit or interest out of the land.. If this \u2022 be so, (and' it is not immaterial in this, case to affirm or deny that position,) tiien the .wiil of John Roper in relation to the bequest to the two papists <em>ioas void </em>under the statute; apd if so, the fight of the heir at law of the testator, to the residue, as a -resubiog trust , was incontestable. The cases above cited have fully established that principle. In that case, too, U16 rents and profits, till the. sale, would, have belonged to the papists, if they were capable of taking, which brought the case still more strongly within the statute ;\u25a0 and this was much relied on, not only- in fea \u2022 soning upon the words, but <em>the policy </em>of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Now, what .is the situation of an alien? He can not only take an interest in - land, but a freehold interest in the land itself, and may hold it against all the world but the king, and even against him until office found, and he is not accountable for -the rents and profits previously received.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> In this case the will being valid, and the. alien capable of taking under it, there can be no resulting trust to the heir, and the claim of the state is founded solely upon a supposed equity, to have' the land <em>by </em>es\u2019cheatj as if the alien had, or could upon the principles of a court ' of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>equity have elected io take the land instead of the money. The points of difference between the two case are ,so striking that it would be a waste of time .to notice them in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\">It may be further observed, that the case of Roper v. Radcliffe has never, in England, been applied to the case of aliens; that if s authority has been'submit' ted to with reluctance, and is. strictly confined in its application to cases precisely parrallel to it. .Lord Mansfield, in.the case-of Foone v. Blount, speaks of it with marked disapprobation; and we know, that had Lord Trevor been present, and declared the opin. ion he had before .entertained, the judges would have been equally divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The case of the Attorney General and Lqrd Weymouth, (Am<em>bler. </em>20.) was also pressed upon the court, as strongly supporting that of Roper v. Radcliffe, and as bearing upon the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">- The fiist of these propositions might be ' admitted ; although it is certain that the mortmain act, upon which that case was decided, is even stronger in its expression than the statute against Papists, and the chancellor so considers it; for, he says, whether the surplus be considered as money or land, it is just the \u00bfame thing, the statute making void all <em>charges-and encumbrances </em>on land, for the benefit of a charity.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">But if this case wege,. in all respects, the same as Roper v. Radcliffe, the observations which have been made upon the latter, would all apply to it. It may be remarked, however, that in this case, the chancellor avoids expressingany opinion upon theques* tiont whether the jjaoney to wise from the sake of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>the land, was to be taken as personalty or land ; and although he mentions the case of Roper v. Radcliffe, he adds, that he does not depend upon it, as it was ims\u00fcateria\u00ed whether the surplus was to b\u00e9 considered as land or money under the mortmain\u2019 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Upbn the whqle, we are unaruinnudy of opinion, that the legacy given to Thomas Craig, in the will of Robert Ciaig, is to be consi.lere.1 as a bequest of personal estate, which he is capable of taking for his own benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Certificate accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\"><em> </em>Vide ante, p. 12.

Under such circumstances, the honour of the country, and the duty of the court, equally require that a just compensation should he made to the unoffending neutrals, for all the injuries losses actually sustained by them. And if this .. , \u2022 . . , , . v , were a suit against the original wrong-doers, it migrit proper to go yet farther,- and visit upon them in s^'aPe exemplary damages, the proper punishment which. \u2022 belongs to such lawless misconduct, _ . . \u2019 \u201d, , , , . .. .

They are innocent of the demer.it o\u00ed'this transaction,'having neither directed it, nor \u2022 countenanced it, nor participated in it in the -slightest degree. Under such circumstances, we are of opinion that they are bound to repair all the real injuries and personal wrongs sustained by the libellants, but they are riot hound to the extent of vindictive damages. While the government of the country shall choose to authorize the employment of privateers in its public Weirs, with the knowledge that such employment cannot be exempt from occasional irregularities and improper conduct, it connot be the duty of courts of justice to defeat the policy of the government,, by burthening the service . with a responsibility beyond what justice requires, with a responsibility for unliquidated damages, resting in mere discretion, and intended t\u00f3 punish offenders.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AUg\">doers in a line trespass \u2022refesponsibl\u00e9 damages,1^but.ke the are not respnn sible beyond the aetuai loss sained.1^ Actual wrong-</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"Ajk9\">\u00a1^\"by'de\u00edeimproper conductofthe cap rejeoted*</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b567-3\">. As the respondents have not appealed from the decree of the circuit court, that decree, so far as it allows damages against .them, is not re-examinable here.\u2014 And the only inquiry will he, whether any of the items allowed by the district court were improperly rejected by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">And first, as to the item of 1,200 dollars, for losses sustained in the sale of the cargo at Antigua. loss is said to have been occasioned partly by the . . \u201e , , . ... terioration of the corn by sea damage, the mixing of the damaged with the sound corn by the \u25a0conduct of the crew of the Spider brig of war, and partly by a fall of the price of corn during the detention of the vessel at Antigua. We are of opinion, that- this item was properly - rejected. The jury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the corn was in no. degree attributable to the improper, conduct o.f the officers and crew.of the privateer. The- vessel was Actually bound lo 'Antigua at the time when she was met by the privateer, under a necessity occasioned by stress of weather, and the fall of.the market there is precisely what would have arisen upon the arrival of the vessel under ordinal ry circumstances. Unless, therefore, the sale .of the corn was compelled at Antigua, solely by the misconduct of.the privateer, ('which, in our opinion^ was the. case,) the claim for such loss cannot be\u2019 sustained.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"Alz\">ornoss\u00edbt\u00f3apro fini-ihcdal&gt;von\" *ge afford ges in a .true rule of da mages xn -such</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b568-3\">Another item is .3,500 dollars,- for . the loss-of the suPPose(l profits of the voyage on which'the AmiaNancy was originally bound. In the opinion of court, this item.'also was properly rejected. The possible benefits of a voyage, as yet <em>in </em>ca.n never afford a safe rule by-which to estimate \u2022 . . damages in cases of. a marine trespass. There is SO- much uncertainty in-the rule itself, so many contingencies which may- vary or extinguish its application', and so many- difficulties in sustaining its legal correctness, that the court cannot believe it proper to entertain it.- Ip several cases in this court, the claim for .-profits has been, expressly overruled; and in Del Col v. Arnold, (3 <em>Dall </em>333.) and the Anna Maria, (2 <em>Wheat. Rep. </em>327.) it was, after strict consideration, held,.that the prime cost, orwalue-of the property lost-, at the time of the loss, and in the case of injury, the diminution-in value, by reason o.f the injury, with interest upon- such valuation, afforded the true measure for assessing, damages; This rule may not secure a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>p\u00edete indemnity for all possible injuries ;. but it has certainty and general applicability to recommend it, and in almost all cases, will give a fair and',just recompense.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"ALX\">Tiie item for jjj\u00ae</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The next item is 2,127 dollars and 60 cents, for the ransom of the vessel .and cargo, and the payment of the costs of court. The evidence upon this is not very satisfactory in. its details. It is asseited that the .vessel was seized for the want of papers, but whether as prize of war, or to enforce a municipal forfeiture, is not distinctly stated ; and no copy of the proceedings of the court is produced to c\u2019enr up a single doubt op obscurity. Nqr does it appear, whether the compromise was made before or after the libel was filed; and it. is admitted that it was made without taking the \u2018 advice of counsel, upon the mere Opinion of a merchant at Antigua, who supposed .that a condemnation would certainly \u2018ensue. Upon what legal grounds this opinion could be reasonably entertained, it is extremely difficult to perceive. Assuming that the vessel and \u2019 cargo were seized as prize of war, it cannot for a moment be admitted, that the mere want of papers could afford-a just cause of condemnation. It might be a circumstance, of. suspicion; but explained (as it must have been) by the preparatory examinations of the officers and crew, and by the f\u00e1ct of a voluntary arrival, it is difficult td suppose that there could be any judicial hesitation \"in immediately acquitting the property. And the farthest that any prize court could, by the utmost straining, be- presumed to go, would be to order.farther proof of the. proprietary interest. It would b\u00e9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>the highest injustice to the British courts to suppose that the mere want of pa'persj under such circumstances, could draw after it the penalty of confiscation. We do not, therefore, think, that the ransom was justifiable or reasonable. The utmost extent of loss to which the owner was liable, wras the payment of the costs and expenses of bringing the property to adjudication ; and for such costs and expenses, as far as they were incur* red and paid, the owner is now entitled to receive a recompense. In this respect, the decree-of the circuit court ought to be amended.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"A9NX\">commfsslon'if8 not allowed.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"AAj\">The item for the supercargo\u2019s commission was also properly rejected. It does not appear, with certainty* sum he was entitled and under the circumstances, if lost, (vrhich. is not satisfactorily shown,) the commissions Were not lost by any act for which the respondents are liable. The sum allowed for the travel, attendence, and expenses of the supercargo in procuring testimony, by the circuit court, is, in our judgment, an adequate compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"AQXm\">The sum of 44 dollars Was (probably by mistake) deducted by the circuit court from the expenses at An tigua. This sum is to be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">To the decree of the circuit court there are, consequently, tobe added'the following sums :</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">For expenses and costs of court at Antigua, 542 dollars, 21 \u25a0 cents.</p>\n<p id=\"Acr\">The loss on the exchange to pay that sum,, (say) 188 dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">The short allowance of expenses, 44 dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">'In the whole, amounting, to the sum of 774 dollars. 21. cents, on which interest, at the rate of 6 pe\u00ed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>cent., is to be allowed from the time of payment up tp the time of this judgment.

Although the original undertaking of an endorser of a promissory note be contingent, and he cannot be -charged without timely notice of non-payment by the maker, yet, when the holder has taken this precaution\u00bb and has proceeded to judgment against both of them, he is at liberty to issue an execution or not,. as he pleases, on the judgment against the maker, withoutafiording any caus\u00e9 of complaint to the endorser ; or if he issues an execution, he is at liberty to make choice ofthe'one which he thinks will be most beneficial to' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>himself, without any consultation whatever with the endorser on the subject; nor ought he to be restrained by any fear of exonerating the endorser, from countermanding. the service of any execution which he may have issued, and proceeding immediately, if he chooses, on the judgment against the indorser. And the reason is obvious; for by the judgment, they have both become principal debtors, and if the endorser Suffers ahy injury by the negligence of the judgment creditor, it is clearly his own fault, it being his duty to pay the money, in which case, he may take under his own direction the judgment obtained against the maker. By an act of Maryland, ft seems expressly provi^ed, which perhaps, only declaratory of the common law, that an endorser may tender to a plaintiff amount of a judgment which he has recovered against the maker of'a note, and obtain an assignment nf u \u201d</p>\n<headnotes id=\"ATN\">By'the'local \u00eda^,P \u00abnd^t mon*uw'X endorser has a to^he^holderl \u00abndtobe sub-regaled to atl his right\u00bb..</headnotes>\n<p id=\"ADC\">., . n, , ., , . ,. . But it is alleged, thatm this case there .was a positive agreement on the part of Mt. Davidson with Mr. Prout, to issue a <em>fieri facias, </em>and proceed therein, and that by not doing .so, the latter was thrown off his guard, and lost the' opportunity of an indemnity out of the estate of Deblois. Without deciding what might have been the effect of such an \u2022 agreement, it -is sufficient to 'say that there1 is no evidence of it. Mr. Davidson expressly denies that he agreed with the complainant, or even promised, him to issue a <em>fieri facias </em>against the estate of Deblois, and that he went no1 farther than to say that he would consult his lawyer. Notbeing.able immediately tp find his lawyer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>and'not knowing whether some advantage might not be taken if he refused to comply with the complainant\u2019s request, he directed a <em>fieri facias, </em>to be issued, which* for reasons assigned by hiin, was afterwards recalled. To this answer of Mr. Davidson, it is supposed, by the claimant\u2019s counsel,- no credit is due, because hi/j commission on the. sum in question gave him an interest in the controversy, and he might b\u00e9 \u00e1nswerable .over to his principal fot his conduct in this business. JVt <em>constad, </em>that he wo.uld be entitled to any commission on this sum. It is quit\u00e9 as probable he 'was acting, under a fixed salary, which would not be affected by the event of the suit; and-as to his responsibility,.none could exist, if he had acted within the Scope of his authority; and if he had transcended his power as agent; it would hardly be fair, that his Constituents should suffer by his act. But admitting both objections, and they will effect the verity of fiis answer; for if lie ha'd a direct interest in the event of the s\u00fait, and to the extent of whole sum in controversy, still his denial pf a fact directly alleged in the bill would be entitled'to full it, according to the rules, of .a court of equity-, Where not a single witness' has been produced to disprove it, and where the circumstances of the case, and hisowij conduct, render his account a very probable vone. If he-had not been made;a defendant, which was, not a very correct course, he migbjt.bav.e-,beep examined as a witness for the other defendant,or. for the complainant; but, haviner been made a defendant; and being the only one acquainted with the transaction, the eoutt is of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>opinion that his answer, uncontradicted as it is,- is proof against the . complainant of the non-existence of any, such agreement as he alleges, was made between them, in relation to the issuing of the <em>fieri </em>facias\u2014 Nor would Mr. Prout have suffered by the-withdrawing of the <em>fieri facias,, </em>which is the burthen of his complaint, if he had'done what he might and ought to have done. He had sufficient notice of this fact,- before the Bit. <em>sa. </em>was served,- to -have' Called and paid the judg-m\u00e9nt against him, and thus have obtained a controul over the one which had 'been recovered against D\u00e9-blois. If he had done this, instead of censuring the conduct of Davidson,- He might have issued <em>&amp; fieri fa-das </em>himself, and' secured a property, whifch if it has not been applied towards his relief, is owing more to his own neglect in not paying, in t\u00edme, a debt justly due-from:himself, than to any other cause whatever.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"Ax-n\">The answerer conclume</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>A person so regardless of his interest, as well as duty, as Mr. Prout has been, who has not only refused to pay \u00e1 note endorsed by him, when due, but' has put the holders to the trouble,delay, and expence, of pro eeeding to judgmen t against him, has but little right to-be dissatisfied, if a court of equity shall not think itself bound by any extraordinary exertions of its powers, to extricate him from- a difficulty and loss which he-might so easily Have avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The decree of the circuit court is reversed, and the complainant\u2019s bill must be dismissed, with the costs of that court, to be paid by the. complainant to the def\u00e9n \u00e1ant.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Decree reversed.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\"> Vide ante, p. 148, Lanusse v.

To the charge delivered by the judge to the' jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Under the 6th' section of the act for the promotion' of useful arts,- and to repeal the act heretofore made for that-purpose, the defendant pleaded the general \u2022 1 \u2022 1 , , , . issue, and -gave notice that he would prove at the trial, that the improved hopperboy, for the use of which, without license, this suit was instituted, had been used previous to the alleged invention of the said Evans^ in several places, (which were specified in the notice,) or in'some of them, \u201cand also' at sundry other places in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and elsewhere in the United States.\u201d Having given evidence as to- some of the places specified in the notice, the defendant offered evidence as:t\u00f3 some other places hot specified. This evidence was objected to by the plaintiff, but admitted by the court; to Which admission the plaintiff \u2019s' counsel excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">The-6th section of the act appeals to be drawn on the idea, that the defendant would not be' at liberty to contest the validity of the1 patent on the general issue. It therefore intends ro relieve the defendant from-the difficulties of-pleading, when it allows him. to give -in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>evidence, itiatter which does affect the patent.' But the notice is directed for the security of the plaintiff,*1 and to protect him-gainst that surprise to which he might be exposed, from an unfair-use ,of this privilege* Reasoning merely on the words directing this notice, it might be difficult to 'define,, with absolute precision, what it ought to- include, and what it,\"might omit.. There are, however, circumstances in the act which, may ha've sojne influence-\u2019on this point. It has been already observed, that the notice is substitute# Spr a special.plea it is farther to be observed, that it is' a substitute' to Which the defendant is not obliged to resort. The notice is'to be given only when'it-is-intended 1 to offer the -special matter in-evidence on the general issue;. The. defendant is not obliged: to pursue this course. He may still plead specially,.and then th\u00e9 plea is the only notice which the- plaintiff cam claim, if,, then, the defendant* may give in evidence* on a special plea the-prior use of the machine hfc places not specified in his plea, it would . seem tp follow that he may give - in evidence its use at- places* not specified in his notice-. It is not believed that a plea would, be defective-, which did not state the mills-in .which the machinery alleged to he previously use# wajs, placed*</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\">But there is still another view of this subject r which- deserves-to Be considered. The- section which directs this notice, also directs that if the special matter stated in the section .be proved, <em>\u2018f </em>judgment shall, btj rendered for,the defendant, with costs,.and the patent shall be -declared void.53 The .notice might'.be: intended not only for the information of the plaintiff* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>but for the purpose of spreading on the record the cause for which the patent . was avoided. This object is accomplished by a notice which specifies the particular-matter to be proved. The ordinary powers of .the court are sufficient to prevent, and will, undoubtedly, be. so exercised, as to prevent the patentee'from being, injured by the surprise.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AhyN\">on tlie part of the plaintiff, that t/hosepriovuse l\u2019ad given evidence,had paid oftheplaimifffor ils^maehim^ jeoted, though eniitledtoverjr weight.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">This testimony having been admitted, tjie <em>rr 3 </em>, * . , ottered to prove that the persons, of whose prior use of- the-improved hopperboy the defendant had given, testimony,, had paid the plaintiff for licenses to. use improved hopperboy in their mills since his pate'nt. This . . * testimony was rejected by the court, on the motion the defendant, and to'this opinion of' the court, also, t\u00e1ie plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"At1\">The testimony offered'by the plaintiff was entitled . . . \u2022 to very,little weight, but ought not to have been lutely rejected. Connected with other testimony! and under some circumstances, even the opinion of a party may be worth something. It is, therefore, -in s.uch a case- as this, deemed more safe to permit it to go to the jury, subject, as all' testimony is, ' to the animadversion of the court, than entirely to exclude it.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">We come next to consider the charge delivered to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">The errors alleged in this charge may be considered ynd\u00e9r two, heads:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">1st.

Blit where, as in this \u2022c\u00e1se, the-words are-ambiguous, these maybe circumstances'which ought to have great.influence .in eapoiinding them. The intention oft he. parties, if that intention can he collected from sources which the princijll.es of law permit us .to . explore, \u00e1re entitled\u2019to great consideration. , <em>Bat </em>before we proceed <em>to\u2019this </em>investigation, it may not be improper to notice the ex-, tent of the authority under which this grantwas issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Nhe authority of the executive to make this grant,' is derived'from the general-patent law, and from the \u00e1ct _ r ' \u2022\u2022 for the relief of Oliver Evans.' On the general patent' law- alone, a doubt might well-arise, whether improvements on different machines could regularly be comprejn saras patent, so as'to give a right to the \u2019 r <em>7 </em>1 . \u00b0 exclusive use of the several machines separately, as- \u2022 \u2022 , , , as arignMp the exclusive use ot those machines: in combination. And if such a patent would be irreg^arj ^ would ceriainly furnish an argument of no in-weight against the construction. But the for the relief of Oliver Evans\u2019* entirely removes doubt. That act authorizes the secretary of-state *ssue a Patent&gt; granting to.the said Oliver Evan's the full and exclusive right, in his invention, discovery, and improvements ,in the art of manufacturing' flpur, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Mi the several machines, which he has invented,\u2022 discovered,improved, and applied to that purpose.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"A73\">intention of patent to O. E.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Of the authority, then,, to make this patent co-extensive with the const ruction,for which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel contends, there can lie no doubt,</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The next object of inquiry is, the intention of'the parties^ so far as it may be collected .from sources to which it is allowable to resort,</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The parties are the government, acting by.its agents, apd Oliver.Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The intention of the.government muy be collected from the \u201cact for the relief of Oliver Evans.\u201d That act not onlyconfers the authority to issue the grant, buti expresses the intention of the legislature -respecting its extent. It may fairly be. inferred from it, that the legislature intended,the patent to include both the general result, and the particular improved machines, if such should be the wish of the applicant. That the executive -officer intended to make the patent co-extensive with the application of Olier Evans, and with the special act, is t\u00f3 be inferred from the \u25a0 reference to both in the patent itself. If, therefore, it shall be satisfactorily shown from his application, to have been tae intention of Oliver Evans to obtain a patent including both objects,that.must be presumed to have been also the intention of. the grant- or.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The first evidence cf the intention of Oliver Evans is furnished by the act for his relief. The fair presumption is, that it conforms to his wishes ; at least, that it does not transcend them.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">The second, is his petition to the secretary of state*. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>which speaks of his'having discoverer1 certain \u2019useful improvements, and prays a patent .for them, \u201cagreeably . to. the act of congress, entitled, an act for the 'relief of Oliver Evans.\u201d. This application is.for, a patent-co-ex- . tensive with the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">This intention.is further manifested by his specification. It is not to be denied, that a part of this specification- would indicate an intention to consider the combined operation of all his machinery as a ^single 'improvement, for which,, he solicited a patent But the, whole taken together, will' not admit of this exposition. The several machines are described with that distinctness which would be used by a person intending to obtain a patent for each. In his number 4., which contains the specification of the drill, he asserts his claim, in terms, to the principles, and to.all the mar chines he had specified, and adds, \u201cthey may all be united and Combined in one flour-mill, to produce n&gt;y improvement in ihte art of manufacturing flour complete, or they maybe used separately for any of the purposes specified and allotted -to-them, or to produce my improvement in part, according to the -circumstances' .'of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">'Being entitled by law to a patent for all and feach \u25a0of his discoveries; considering himself, as he avers in his specification and affirmation, as the inventor\u00bb-of each of these, improvements; understanding, as he dedales he did, that they might be used together so as to produce his improvement complete, or Separately, \u25a0 soas toproduce.it in part;- nothing can be more iifaprobable, chan that Oliver Evans intended to obtain a patent solely for their combined operation. His affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>mation, which is annexed to his specification, confirms this reasoning. To the-declaration that he is the inventor of these improvements, he adds, \u201cfor which he solicits a patent.\u201d &gt;</p>\n<headnotes id=\"ACb\">Construction QleE pat*\u201ct</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">With this conviction of the intention with which it was framed, the instrument is to be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The patent begins with a recital, that Oliver Evans \u25a0had alleged himself to be the inventor, of a ne'w and useful improvement in the art of manufacturing fl\u00f3ur, &amp;.c. by the means of several machines, for a description Ofwhich reference is made to his specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">It will not be denied, that if the allegation of Oliver Evans was necessarily to be understood-as conforming to this recital, if our knowledge of it was to be derived entirely from'this source, the fair construction would be, that his application was singly for the exclusive-right to that improvement which was produced by the combined operation of his machinery. But in construing these terms, the court is not confined to their most obvious import The allegation made by Oliver Evans, and here-intended to be recited, is in his petition to thesecretary of state. That petition is embodied in, and becomes a part of the patent. It explains itself, and controls the. words of reference to it. His allegation is not \u201cthat he has invented a new and Useful improvement,\u201d but that he has discovered' certain useful improvements. The words used by the department of state in reciting this-allegation, must-then be expounded by the allegation itself, which is madfe \u00e1 part of the patent</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The recital proceeds, \u201cwhich improvement has not been known,\u201d &amp;c. These words refer clearly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the. improvement first mentioned and alleged in the petition of Oliver Evans, and are of course to be con-, trolled-in, like manner with the antecedent - words, by \u2022 that .petition. This part of the recital is concluded by adding, that Oliver Evans-has affirmed, that -he -does verily b\u00e9lieye. himself to be .the.true investor or discoverer Of the said improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">But the affirmation of Oliver Evans, like his petition, is\u00a1. embodied .in the grant, and-must, of course, expound the recital of it.- That affirmation is, that he does verily believe himself to he -the true and original inyentor of the <em>imprcvemcntsc.cntained </em>in his specifitioiu,</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">In every instance, then, in which the word improvement is used in the singular number - throughout the part of recital of this patent, it is used in reference to a paper contained in. the body of the patent, which corrects the term, and shows it to be inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">. The patent, still by way of recital, proceeds to add, \u201cand agreeably to. the act of congress, entitled \u00a3an act for the relief of Oliver Evans,\u2019which authorizes! the secretary of state to'secure to him, by patent, the 'exclusive right to the use of such <em>improvement </em>in the ait of manufacturing flour' an 1 iheal, and in 'the* several machines which he has discovered1, improved, and applied to that purpose ; he has paid into the treasury, &amp;c. and piesented a petition to the secretary of state, signifying a desire o\"f obtaining an exclusive property in the said <em>improvement, </em>and praying that a patent may be granted for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>To what- do the words \u201csaid .improvement\u201d relate? The answer which has been given at the bar is entirely cOrtect. To the improvement mentioned in the stat-i ufe and in tim,petition, to both of which .direct refer enee is made'i \u00a3but in.the statute, and in the petition, the Word used, is <em>\u201cirriprwements'f'-'m </em>the plural.. The patent, therefore, obviously. affixed to the word improvement, in the singular, the same sense in which the ' plural is1 employed,, both in the statute and .in the petition. We are compelled' from the whole context so to construe the word in every place in vfliich it is tiSed in the recital, because' it is constantly employed With express reference to the act of congress, Or t\u00f3 Some document embodied in-the patent, in each of which 'the\u2018pleural is1 used*</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">' When, then, the words \u201csaid improvement\u201d- are us1ed as a term of grant, they refer to'the Words Of the recital,- which' have been already noticed, and, miist be construed in the same sense. This construction is rendered the more necessary by the subsequent words, \u2022Which refer for a description of -thd improvement to the schedule. It also derives some weight from the words \u2018^according to law,\u201d which are annexed to the words of grant. 1 These words can refer only to the general patent law,'and to the'\u201cact for the:relief of Oliver Evans.\u201d These acts, tahen together, seem to require that th\u00e9 patent should:- con* form to the specification, affirmation, and petition of the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">It would seem as if the claim of \\01iver Evans was rested-at the circuit- court, on the . principle, that a grant for an improvement, by the combined--operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>of all the machinery, necessarily-included a right to .the distinct operation of each part, inasmuch as the whole comprehends all its parts. After very'properly rejecting this idea, the judge appears to have considered the department of state, and the patentee* as haying proceeded upon it in making out this patent. He supposed the intention to be, to convey the excl ive right in the parts as well as in the whole,.by a grant-of the whble; but as the means used are in law incompetent to produce the effect, he construed the grant according to his opinion of its legal operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\">There i\u00bb great reason in this view of. the ease,, and-this court has not discarded it without hesitation;. Rut as to the-grant, with the various documents which-forara part of it, would be contradictory to itself; as these-apparent contradictions are all reconciled by considering the yvord \u201cimprovement\u201d, to be in the plural instead of the singular number; as it is apparent that \"this construction gives-to the grant its full effect\"^ and that the opposite construction would essentially defeat itr.this court has, after much consideration and d\u00f3u'btv determined to adopt it, as the sound exposition of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The second error alleged in the charge, is in directing -the jury to find for the defendant, if they should he of opinion that the hopperboy was in use prior to the improvement alleged to- be. made thereon -by Oliver Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">This part of the. charge seems to be founded o\u00bb the opinion, that if the patent is to be considered as a grant of the exclusive use \\of distinct improvements-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>it \u00eds; a grant sor the hopperboy itself, and not for an' improvement on the hopperboy.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"A7bP\">decide th\u00ab fact., that an in dividual is an Mentor,so as to cSflnquirydnt0 the original it&gt; of the authorship or inthS os'll mayt ^\"lecidcd\u2019the</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u2022Thecounsel for the plaintiff contends, that this partosfthe charge is erroneous, because, by the \u201cact for the relief of Oliver Evans,\u201d Congress has itself decided that he is the inventor of the machipes for which he' solicited' a patent', and has' left that point open to judicial inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">This court is not of that opinion. Without inquiring whether Congress, in the exercise of its \u00b0 . . . r \u201c'to'secure for limited times, to authors and' inventors, the exclusive right to their .respective writings and discoveries,\u201d ibay decide the fact that an individual is an author or'inventor, the court can never presume Con- . , <em>r </em>gress to have decided that question in a general act, the words of which do not render such construction unThe words of this act d;o not require this They do not grant to Oliver Evans exclusive right to use certain specified machines;' but the exclusive' right to useyhis invention, discovery, and improvements ; leaving the question of invention and improvement open to investigation, under the general patent law. avoidable construction'.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-21\">The plaintiff has also contended, that it is not necessary for the patentee. to show himself to Be the first inventor or discoverer. That the law is satisfied by his having invented a machine, although it may have been previously discovered' by some other per\u2019 son.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-22\">Without a critical inquiry into the accuracy with which, the terra invention or discovery niay be applied to any. other than the first inventor, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>considers.this question as completely decided by the 6th section of the general .patent act. That- declares} that if the thing was not <em>originally </em>discovered by lie patentee, but had been in us\u00e9, or had heeii described in some public work, anterior to the sup-discovery of the patentee, judgment shall be \u201crendered for the defendant, and. the patent declared , * void.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AO6x\">cured scribed in public work anterior <em>to </em>the covery!the pa whether this previousa .Son ordn\u00f3ti'P</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"AB4X\">0.-E; i* emit patent^to the 2fCthe!wvc'ral praehinea. \u2019\u25a0 which^he has invented, and \u00f3f hia improve menta op ma Sily\u2019diKover</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">Admitting the words <em>\u201c originally </em>discovered,\u201d to explained or limited by the subsequent words, still thing had been in use, or had been described in public work, anterior to the supposed discovery, the patent is void. It may be . that the patentee\u2019 had no knowledge .of this previous use or previous description ; still his patent is void: the law supposes he may have known it; and the charge of the judge, which must be taken as applicable to the testimony, goes no farther than the law.</p>\n<p id=\"A-Y\">The .real inquiry is, does the patent of- Oliver Evans comprehend more than he has discovered ? If it is for the- whole, hopperboy, the . jury has found that this machine was ip previous use. If it embraces , . , v ,. . , 0p]y his improvement, then the verdict must beset ' aside.</p>\n<p id=\"A-7\">: The difficulties which embarrass this inquiry are not. less than those which were involved in the first point. Ambiguities are still to be cxplhined, and contradictions to be reconciled. .</p>\n<p id=\"b522-21\">.. H'he patent itself, construed without reference, to the schedule and other doCumeftts to which it refers, and which are . incorporated in it,. would be a grant ..^\u00a1f a. single improvement 5 but construed with those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>documents, it has been determined to.ba a grant o\u00ed the several improvements which he has made in the maehiiies enumerated'ip. his .specification.\u2019 But the grant i,s confined to improvements. There is no ex -pression in it -hich exten.ds to the whole of any one of the machines which are. enumerated in his specification or petition. The difficulty grows out of-the complexity and ambiguity of the specification and petition.

Taking the. whole together, the court is of opinion, that the patent is to be constructed as a grant of the general result of the whole machinery, and of the improvement in each machine. Great douht existed whether the \u25a0foords Qf the grant, which are expressed to be for an <em>improvement or improvements </em>only, should be understood as purporting to be a patent only for improvements; or should be so far controuled by the specification and petition,.as to be considered as a grant for the machine as improved, of in the words of.the schedule andpetition, for \u201can improved elevator, an improved conveyor, an improved hopperboy, an improved drill, and an improved kiln dryer.\u201d The majority of the court came at length to the opinion, that there is no substantial difference, ,as they \u2022 are used in this grant, whether the words grant a patent for an improvement on a machine, or a patept for an improved machine-.; since the machine itself, without the improvement, would not be an improved -.machine. Although I.did not concur in this opinion, I can perceive no inconvenience from the construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">It is, then, the opinion.of this court, that Oliver Evans may cla.im, under -his patent, the exclusive use of his inventions and improvements in the art of manufacturing flour and meal, a-nd in the several machines which he has invented, and in his improvements on machines previously discovered.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"Ats\">Where claim of O.

The testimony .the carpenter and cook of the- captured vessel distinctly asserts that the ship, at the time of the capture, was laying at anchor about a mile from the shore of island. The testimony of the captors as distinctly, asserts, that the ship then lay at a distance of from four to five miles from the , shore. It is contended, by the counsel for the claimants, that captors, are. in no cases admissible witnesses in prize causes being rendered incompetent by reason of their interest. \u2018 It is certainly true, that, upon the .original hearing, no other evidence \u2022 is . admissible than that of the. ship\u2019s papers, and the preparatory examinations the captured crew. But, upon an order for far-proof, where the benefit of it is allowed to'the captors, their attestations are clearly admissible evi\u00a3[ence This is the ordinary' course of prize courts, <em>\u25a0 J </em>. , 1 ' 7 especially where it becomes material to ascertain the r <em>r ! , . </em>circumstances of the capture; tor tn sura cases the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>facts'lie as much within the knowledge of the cap\u00edorS \u00e1sthe captured; and the objection of interest generally applies as strongly to the one party as to the other. It'is a mistake, to suppose that the common law doctrine, as to competency, is: applicable to prize proceedings. In courts of prize, no person is incompe-' tent mer\u00e9ly on the ground of interest. His testimony is admissible, subject t\u00f3 all exceptions as .to its crqdibflity. The cases cited at the argument distinctly support this position ; and they are perfectly consistent with fhe principles by which courts of prize profess to regulate their proceedings. We. are, therefore, of opi\u00f1ion, that the attestations ,of the eaptors are le-. gal. evidence in the case, and it remains to examine their credit. And without entering into a minute examination, in this conflict of .testimony, we are of opinion, that the weight of evidence is, decidedly, that the capture was made within the territorial limits of Spanish St, Domingo.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">And this brings us to the second question in the cause; and that is, whether it was compet\u00e9nt for the Spanish . <em>r </em>consul, merely by virtue of his office, and without the special authority of his government, to interpose a claim in this case for the assertion of the violated rights of his sovereign. We are of opinion, that his , , . office confers on him no such legal competency. A .consul, though a public agent, is supposed to be clothed with authority only for' ecinmercial purposes. He has an undoubted right to interpose claims for the restitution of property belonging to the subjects of Jiis own country; but he is hot considered as a minister, or di \u2022 plomatic agent of his sovereign, intrusted, by virtue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>of his office, with authority to represent him in hisne g0tiations with foreign states, or to vindicate his prero- . 5 . \u25a0 \u2019 <em>v </em>gatrves. 1 here is no doubt, that his sovereign may specially intrust him with such authority; but in such case his diplomatic character is superadded to his ordinary powers, and ought to be recognized by the government within whose dominions he assumes to exercise it. There is no suggestion, or proof, of any such delegation of special authority in this case; and therefore we consider this claim as asserted by an incompetent person and on that ground it ought to be dismiss-sed. It is admitted, that a claim by a public minister, or in his absence, by a charge d\u2019\u00e1ffairs in'behalf of his sovereign would be good. But in making this admission, it is not to be understood that it can be made in a court of justice without the assent or sanction of the government in Whose courts the cause is depending. That is a question of great importance, upon which this court expressly reserve their opinion, until the point shall come directly in judgment.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The claim of the Spanish government for the violation of its neutral territory being thus disposed of, It is next to be considered whether the British claimant can assert any title founded upon that circumstance. By the return of peace, the claimant became rehabilitated with the capacity to sustain a suit in the courts of this country; and the argument is that a capture made in a neutral territory is. void and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>therefore, the title by capture being invalid, the Brt-. tish owner has a right to restitution. The difficulty of this argument rests in the incorrectness of the premises. \u00c1 capture made within neutr\u00e1l waters is, as between enemies, deemed, to all intents, and purposes, rightful; it is only by the neutral sovereign that its legal validity can he called in question; and as to him and him only; is it to be considered void. The enemy has no rights whatsoever ; and if the neutral sovereign-, omits or declines to interpose a claim, the property is condemns ble, jure <em>lelh^ </em>to the captors. This is.the clear result of the authorities; and the doctrine rests, oh well established principles of public law.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<headnotes id=\"AdXM\">_A capture within neutral territory is rightful, as between the belligerents; the neutral state a lone can question its validity-</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"AcT\">- Captured ship first conwrten-. cing hostilities upon tli* cap tor, forfeits the neutral protas tion.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"A9F\">There is one other point in the c\u00e1se which, if all other difficulties were removed, would be decisive against the claimant. It is a fact that the captured ship first commenced- hostilities against the privateer. This is admitted on all sides ; and it is no excuse to assert that it was done under a mistake of the national character of the privateer, even if this were entirely made out in the evidence. While the ship was lying in neutral waters,, she, was bound to abstain1 from all hostilities, except in self defence. The privateer had \u00e1n equal title, with herself to the neutral protectionr.an,d was in no default in approaching the coast without showing: - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>her national character. It was. a violation of that neutrality which the captured ship was bound to observe, to-commencehostilities for any purpose in-these waters; for no-vessel coming thither was bound to submit to search, or to account to her for her conduct or character. When, therefore, she commenced hostilities, she forfeited the neutral protection, and the capture was no injury for which any redress could be rightfully sought from the neutral'sovereign.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The conclusion from all these views of the .case is, that the ship and cargo ought to be condemned as \u25a0good prize of war. And the only remaining inquiry is, whether the captors have so conducted themsel ves as to have forfeited the rights given by their c\u00f3mmission, so that the condemnation ought to' be to the United Spates. There can be no doubt, that .if captors are guilty of gross misconduct, or laches, in violation of their duty, courts of prize will - visit upon thepi the penalty of a forfeiture of the rights of prize, especially- where the government chooses to interpose a claim to.assert such forfeiture. Cases of gross irregularity, or fraud, may readily be Imagined in which it would become the duty of this court to enforce this principle in -its utmost rigour. But it has never been supposed that irregularities, which have-arisen from mere mistake, or negligence, when they, work no irreparable mischief,.and are consistent with good faith, have ordinarily induced such penal consequences. There wrere some irregularities in this case; but there is no evidence upon the record from which we can infer that there was any fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>suppression,, or any gross misconduct inconsistent with good faith; and, therefore, ,we are of opinion, that condemnation ought to be to the captors..</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">It is the unanimous opinion of the court, that the decree of the circuit court be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\"><em> </em>See Viveash v.

N.ew^ if there be nothing'criminal in a vessel coming qn. our \u25a0coast, with a <em>boriajide </em>intention of ascertaining wherthi er under existing laws, she would be permitted town \u00a1entry; vet, when a vessel is found in this. situation, in a boisterous season of the year, and so very, mUch.oujt of the way of the place to which it was pretended- sh\u00e9 was .destined, if our ports were shut,' apd then relies on-the pl\u00e9\u00e1 of distress for' the coming in, a court will require the most satisfactory proof of the necessity-which is urged m her defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">To make out this necessity, the principal;, if sot the only witness,produced, are the master and supercargo Oat of fifteen persons, these two are selected, and relied bn to establish this all-important fact. No .survey is had of the vessel or cargo either before or after it: was discharged. To these two .witnesses, if they stated a sufficient distress, which is not conceded, very serjt ous objections lie. The master, is so much.implicated Hi till the transactions of this nature, that it must *1- - waiys be mere or less hazardous fora claimant tores-'---1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>to his testimony, when other ' and. less exceptionable witnesses 'are at hand. -Not only some inf the seamen \u2022on board might have -been examined; but why not call on persons residing at the place where the vessel dis* ^charged, to examine her, and .to give their testimony, Such persons were at hand, for the master speaks of three ship masters who surveyed her, and gave their opinion. As-no survey ifc-produced and neither of these ship masters is a witness, the court can take no notice' of any opinion they may have entertained or have given to the master of the ASolus. The testimony of the supercargo on this subject, if if made out an adequate cause for coming in, would have beep entitled to more credit if he had behaved throughout this transaction in. a manner more consistent than he appears to have done. . But independent of this conduct, there are parts of his testimony which it is very difficult'to. believes and which throw a shade over the whole. He swears' that his instructions, for Morgan Were not in writing, and that he had never received er-1 ther from him or Scholtz, any l.ett\u00e9r concerning his voyage. It is incredible that any man should be entrusted with, so large a property, without\u2018other than verbal instructions; or, at any rate,, it is so entirely out of the .common course of business, that the court cannot b\u00e9 blamed for disbelieving it. But ther\u00e9-, ar\u00e9 other cir cumstances which detract much froialka\u00ab&amp;?edii of these two witnesses. There is every reason to' believe from other evidence in the canse,, that when the brig came info Bass-Harbour, neither of them thought of justifying their conduct on the ground of necessity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>This suggestion was made to them by Mr. Wood, and not until they had been there a week or longer. This fact is proved in a way to admit of but little. doubt of its accuracy ; not only by the profound silence which was observed on this subject by the master and others* for some, time after the arrival of the brig, but by positive testimony, which establishes that the' allegation of distress was a, matter of concert between the superr cargo of Mr. Wood. It also appears by other witnesses in the cause, that the \u00bfEolus, notwithstanding the injuries which she had received, might have proceeded to-the West-Indies without any other repairs.than such as might have been put-qn her .at sea. Upon the whole, the court is of opinion that the. coining in- of the iEelus Was voluntary, and not produced by any distress whic-h' could justify the measure^ aqd that thereiipoh fee sentence of the circuit court must be affirmed with costs;.</p>\n</opinion>", "html_with_citations": "", "extracted_by_ocr": true, "opinions_cited": []}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/8373744/", "id": 8373744, "absolute_url": "/opinion/8403402/united-states-v-bevans/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/8403402/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2022-10-17T19:25:15.167640-07:00", "date_modified": "2022-10-17T19:25:15.167654-07:00", "author_str": "Marshall", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "020lead", "sha1": "", "page_count": null, "download_url": null, "local_path": null, "plain_text": "", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "<opinion type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"APle\">Mr. Chief Justice Marshall</author>\n<p id=\"A7e\">'delivered thb opinion of th\u00abr court. The question proposed by. the circuit court, which will be first considered,'is,</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Whether the offence charged in this indictment was, according to the statement'of facts which accompanies the question, \u201cwithin the jurisdiction' or cognizance of the circuit court of the United States for. the districhof Massachusetts ?\u2019?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The indictment appears t\u00f3 be founded on the 8th sec. of the \u201cact for the punishment of certain crimes against the United .States.\u201d- That section gives the courts of th&gt;2 union cognizar ce of certain offences committed on the high sens, or in any river,, haven, basin, or bay, oiit of the jurisdiction of any particular state.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Whatever may be the constitutional' power' of congress, it is clear that this power has not been so.exercised, in this section of the act, as to confer on its Courts jurisdiction over any offence committed in a river, haven, basin or bay ; which river, hayen, basin\u00bb or bay, is within, the jurisdiction of any particular state.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">What thfenis the extent of jurisdiction which a state possesses ?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">Weanswer, without hesitation,' the jurisdiction \u00abC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>a s\u00edate is co-extensive with its territory ; jo-extensive with its legislative power. _</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">_ The place described is unquestionably within the origirial territory of Massachusetts!: It is then within the jurisdiction of-Massachusetts, unless that; jurisdiction has been ceded by the United States. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">It is contended to have, been ceded by-that article in the constitution which declares, that \u201cthe' judicial power shall extend to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.\u201d The argument is, that the power thus granted is exclusive ; and that the murder com mitted by the prisoner is a case of admiralty and maritime j urisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Let this be admitted. . It proves the power of congress to legislate in the case; not, that pdngress has exercised that power. It has been argued,-and the argument in a favour of, as well as that against the proposition deserves great consideration, that courts of comipon law have concurrent jurisdiction with courts of admiralty, over murder committed in bays, which are inclosed parts of the sea ; and that for this reason the offence is within the jurisdiction of Massachusetts. But in construing the act of. congress, {he ' court ber lieves it to be unnecessary to.pursue the investigation which has been so, well made at the- bar -respecting the jurisdiction of these'rival co\u00fcrts.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">To bring the offence within the jurisdiction of the courts of the union, it must have bean committed in-a' river, &amp;c. out of the jurisdiction of any state. It is not the offence committed, but the bay in which it is committed, which must be out of the jurisdiction, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>state. If, then, it should be true that Massachusetts Can ta^e n0 cogn^zance of\"the offence.; yet, unless the place itself be out of her jurisdiction, congress has not given cognizance of that offence to its courts. If there be a common jurisdiction, the-crime .cannot be punished the courts of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"ApI\">\u25a0Can the cession of all cases of admiralty and raaritime furisdiction be construed into a cession ofthe waters on which those cases may arise.</p>\n<p id=\"A1h\">This is a question on which th3 court is incapable of feeling a doubt. The article which describes thejudicial power of the United States is not intended for the cession, of territory ,or of general jurisdiction. It \u2022is obviously designed for other purposes. It is in the 8th section of the 2d article, we are to look for cessions ,of territory and of exclusive jurisdiction. Congress has power to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over this district, and over all places purchased by the consent -ofthe legislature of the state in which the same shall be; cfor the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock. yards, and'other needful buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"Ass\">-It is observable, that the power of exclusive legislation (which is jurisdiction) is united with -cession of territority, which is- to be the free act of the states. It is difficult to compare the two sections together; without feeling a conviction, not to be strengthened by .-any commentary on them, that, in describing the judicial power, the.f nmens of our constitution had not in view any cession of territory, dr, whicli is essentially the same, of general jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\"><em>It </em>is not questioned, that whatever may be necessary to the full and unlimited exercise of admiralty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\u2022and maritime jurisdiction, is in the-government of the union. Congress may pass all laws which are nec.es \u2022 sary and proper for giving the most complete effect to this power. Still, the general jurisdiction over, the place, subject to this grant of power, adheres to the territory, as a portion of sovereignty not yet given- away. The residuary powers of legislation are still in Massachusetts. Suppose for example the power of regulating trade had not been given to the general government* Would this extension of the judicial power to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, have devested Massachusetts of the power to regulate the trade of her bay? A\u00e1 the powers of the respective, governments now stand, if two\u2019 citizens of Massachusetts step into shallow water when the tide flows, and fight a duel,-are they not within the jurisdiction, and .punishable by the laws of Massachusetts'? If these ques- ' tions must be answered in the' affirmative, and we believe they must, then the bay in which this murder was committed, is not out of the jurisdiction of \u00e1 state, and .the circuit court of Massachusetts is not authorized, by the section under consideration, to take cognizance of the'murder which had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">It may he deemed within the scope of the question certified to this court, to inquire whether any other part of the act has given cognizance of this.murder to the circuit court of Massachusetts'?</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The third section enacts, \u201cthat ifany .person or. persons shall, within any fort, arsenal, dockyard, maga- \u2019 zine, or in any other place, or district of country, under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>States, commit the crime of wPful murder,' such person or persons, on being thereof convicted, s*hall suffer death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYM\">Although the bay on which this murder was committed might not be out of the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, the ship of war om the deck of which it was Committed,.is, it has been said, \u201ca <em>place </em>wilhin'th\u00e9 sole -and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d whose courts may \u25a0 consequently take cognizance of the offence.</p>\n<p id=\"Arx\">That a government which possesses the broad power of war; which \u201cmay provide and maintain a navy;\u201d ,which \u201cmay make rules' for the government and regulation of th.e land and navel forces,\u201d has power to punish an offence committed by a marine on board'a ship of w.ar, wherever t-hat ship may lie, is a jw&amp;pposition never to be questioned in this court. On this section, as on the 8th, thfe inquiry respects, not the extent of the power of Congress, but the extent to. which-that power has been exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"AhhV\"><em>\\ </em>The objects with which the word \u201cplace\u201d is associated,.are all, in their nature,'fixed and territorial. A fort, an arsenal, a dock-yard,' a magazine, are all of this character. When the sentence proceeds with the words, \u201cor in any other place or district of country under' the sole and exclusive 'jurisdiction of the United States;\u201d the construction seems irresistible that, by the words \u201cother place\u201d was intended another place of a similar character' with those previously enumerated, and with that which follows. Congress might have omitted, in its enumeration, eota\u00e9 \u2022-similar place within its exclusive jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u25a0which was not comprehended by any of the terms em* ployed to which some other name, might he given ; and, therefore, the words, \u201cother place,\u201d or \u201cdistrict of country,\u201d were added;. But the context shows the mind of the legislature to have Been, fixed on territorial ob* jects of a similar character.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">This construction's strengthened by the fact (hatv at the time of passing.this law, the United States did not possess a single.ship of war. It may, therefore, be reasonably supposed, that a provision for the punishment' of crimes'in the navy might be postponed until some provision for a navy should be made. While taking; this view of the subject, it is not entirely unworthy of remark, that afterwards, when a navy was created, \u00e1nd1. congress did not proceed to make'rules for its. regulation and governmeutj no jurisdiction is given, to the' courts of the United States, of any crime committed in a ship\u2019of war,'wherever it miy be\u2019 stationed.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> . Upon these reasons the court is ,of opinion, that a murder committed on board a ship of -war, \u25a0 lying within the ^arbour of' Boston, is not cognizable in the circuit: court for the district Of Massachusetts ; ]\u00a1vhich opinion is to be certified to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The opinion of the court, on this point, is believed., to render it unnecessary co decide the question respecting the jurisdiction of the state court in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Certificate accordingly..</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\"> Ths, it is conceived, refers to the ordinary courts of the United States, proceeding according to the law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>land.

The satne rule applies to judgments and decrees of a state court, in cases within the jurisdiction of this court. As the constitutional jurisdiction of the courts of the union cannot be affected by any regulation which a state may make of its own judicial system, the only inquiry will be, whether the judiciary act has been so framed as to embrace this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">The words of the act are, \u201c that a final judgment tor decree in any suit in the highest court of law or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>equity of a state in which a decision could be had, where is drawn in question,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cmay be re-examinod and reversed or affirmed in the supreme court of the United States upon a writ of error, the citation being signed,\u201d &amp;c. The act does not prescribe the tribunal to which the writ of error shall be directed. It must be directed either to that tribunal. which cars execute'll; to that in which the record and judgment to he examined are deposited, or to that whose judgment is to be examined, although from its structure it may have been rendered incapable of performing the act required-by the writ. Since the low requires a thing to he done, and gives the writ of error, as the means by which it is to be done, without prescribing in this particular the manner in which the writ is to be used, it appears to the court to be perfectly clear that the writ must be so used as to effect the object. It may then* be. directed to either court in which the record and judgment on which it .is to act may be found.\u2019 The judgment- to he examined- must be that of the highest court of the state having cognizance of the case,- but the record- of that, judgment may he brought from any court in which it may be legally deposited, and in which it may he found by the writ</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In this case, the writ was directed to the court of errors, which) having parted with the record,- could not execute it. It was then presented to the supreme court; but, being directed to' the court of errors, could not regularly be executed by that court. In this 'State of thiags the parties consented to waive all ob_ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>jections to the direction of the writ, and to consider the record as properly brought up, it, in the opinion of this court, it could be now properly brought up on a writ of error directed to the supreme court of Ne&gt;v-York, The court being of opinion that this may be done, the case' stands as if the\" writ of error had been properly directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The original suit was brought by the defendant in error against the plaintiffs in error for an. alleged trespass for taking and carrying -away, and con verting.to their own use, the ship American Eagle, and her appurtenances, and certain ballast and articles of pro-, visions, &amp;c. the property of the defendant in error. This is the substance of the declaration, although there are some differences in alleging the tort in the different counts. The original defendants pleaded, in the first place, the general issue, not guilty, to the whole declaration ; and then two special pleas. The first special plea,'in substance, alleges^ that the said' ship was attempted to be fitted out and armed, and that the ballast and provisions were procured for the equipment of the said ship, and were put on bo\u00e1rd of the said ship as,a part of her said equipment, with intent that .the said ship should.be employed .in the service of a foreign state, <em>to wit, of that part of the island of St, Domingo which was then under the government of Petion, </em>to commit hostilities upon the subjects of. another foreign statej with which the United States \u25a0were then-at peace, <em>to wit, of that part, of the island of St. Domingo which was then under the government ofChristophe, </em>contrary to the. form of the statute .in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>,auch case roadeand provided; and that the original defendants, by virtue of the power and authority, awd in pursuance of the instruction sand directions of the president of the United1 States, seized the said ship* &amp;c. as forfeited to the use of the United States, According to the statute aforesaid, &amp;c. The second special plea is like the first, except that it does not state,,that the ship Was seized as forfeited, but alleges that the ship ;was- taken possession of, and detained., under the instructions of the president of the United States, in order to the execution;of the prohibition aftd penalties of the act in such case made and provided, and except'. that ,it omits the allegations lintifer the videlicets in the first plea, specifying the? foreign state b'y or Against whom the said ship was ,to.,be employed. To these pleas tfieFe is a general deihurret, and joinder in demurrer, updn .which thfe state court gay\u00e9 judgment ih favour, of the original. plaintiff. Upon the trial of the general issue, a'bill o\u00a3 exceptions was taken to the opinion-of the court. By that bill' of exceptions, among other things, it appears, that the original\u2019plaintiff, at' the trial, gave, in evidence, that at the time of the seizure the ship was in his actual full and peaceable possession ; that the ship, upon tjie seizure, had been duly\" libelled for the alleged offence in the district eonrt of New-York\u2022 th\u00e1t the original plaintiff appeared and duly claimed! the said, ship; and upon the trial she was duty acquitted, and ordered to be restored? to the original plaintiff by the district court'; and that a certificate-Of reasonable cause for the seizure of the s\u00e1id ship had -beair deiutd. The plaintiff -then gav\u00e9in evl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>dence, that the Value of the ship at the tim\u00e9 of her seizure was 100,000' dollars; and that the said Schenck seized and took possession of the said ship by the written directions of the said Gelston; but no other proof was offered by the plaintiff, at that time, of any right Or title in the said plaintiff to the said ship ; and here the original plaintiff rested his cause. The original defendants then insisted before the court, that the laid several matters, so produced and given in evidenc\u00e9 on the part of the original plaintiff, were hot sufficient to entitle him to a verdict, and prayed the court so to pronounce, and to nonsuit the' plaintiff. But the court refused the application, and declared^ thaf the said several matters so produced and given in evidence were sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict, and that he ought not to be nonsuited. To which opinion the, original defendants then excepted; and the original plaintiff then gave in evidence that he purchased the said ship of James Gillespie, who bad purchase her of John R. Livingston and Isaac Glason, the owners thereof, and Uiat in pursuance of such purchase, the said Gillespie had delivered full ahd c\u00f3m-\u2020 p\u00edete possession of the said ship, &amp;c. to the original' plaintiff, before the taking thereof by the original defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The original defendants (having given previoas notice of the special matter of defence to be given in evidence on the trial under the general issue, accordlng to the laws of New-York,) offered to prove and give in evidence, by the way <em>of defence and in mitigation </em>of damages, the same matter. of forfeiture alleged in their first special plea, with the additional ...fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the \u00abaid Gelston was collector, and the said. SchencR was surveyor of the customs of the district of\u2019 rsewYork, and as such, and not otherwise, made the seizure' of the ship, &amp;c.. And' the original defendants did, thereupon, insist that the said . several matters, so ofiered to be proved and given in evidence,- ought to be admitted in justification of the trespass charged against the defendants, or in mitigation' of the damages, claimed by the plaintiff, and prayed the court So to admit it. But the counsel for the plaintiff, admitting that the \u00a1defendants' had not been influenced by any malicious motive in making the said seizure, and that they had not acted with any view or design of oppressing or injuring the plaintiff, the court overruled the whole of the said \u00a1evidence so offered to he proved by the original defendants, and did declare it to be inadmissible in justification of the trespass charged against the defendants;' fend after'the admission so mad\u00e9 by the original plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that the said evidence ought not to be received in mitigation or diminution of the said drimages, as the said admission precluded the plaintiff from claiming any damages by way of punishment or smart money; and that after such admission the plaintiff could only recover the damages actually sustained, and with that direction left the cause to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">From this summary of the pleadings, and of the facts in controversy at the trial, it is apparent that, this court has appellate jurisdiction ofthis cause, only so far as is drawn in question the validity ot an \u25a0 authority exercised under, the United Stales, . and the decision is against the validity thereof arid so far.as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>is drawn in question the construction of some clause in a statute of the United States, and the decision- is against the title, right, privilege, or exemption specially set up or claimed by the original defendants, for to such questions, (so far as respects this case,) the 25th section of the judiciary act has expressly restricted our examination. - Whether such a restriction. be not inconsistent with sound public policy, and does not materially impair the rights of other, parties as'well as of the United States, is an inquiry deserving- of the most serious attention of the legislature.. We'have' nbthing to do but to expound the law as we find it; the defects of the system must be remedied by.another department of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The cause will be first considered in reference to the bill of exceptions. In respect to the proof of the original plaintiff\u2019s cause.of action, and the opinion of the court that such proof was sufficient to entitle hhn to a verdict, no err^r has been shown upon the argument; and certainly none is perceived by this qourt. If,, however, there were any error In that opinion, we could not re-examine it, for it is not within the purview of the statute. It does not draw..in question, any authority exercised under the United-States, nor the construction of any statute of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In respect to the rejection of the evidence offered by . the. original defendants to prove the forfeiture, and their right of seizure, there can be n6 doubt that this court has appellate jurisdiction,-if by law that evidence ought to have'b\u00e9\u00e9n , admitted in justification of \"the trespass charged on the .-\u2018Original defendants;.for it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>iftf httbS the construction of a statute of, and an autjihnty derived from, and exercised under, the United States.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AIY\">At common lw any son may,at. his peril, seize for the01 'govern-went.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">In order to establish the admissibility of the evidence offered by he defendants, it is necessary for them to sustain the affirmative of the following propositions. 1. That a forfeiture had been actually incurred under the statute of 1794, ch\u201e 50. \u2014 2\u00bb That it w\u00e1s competent for a state court of common law to entertain and decide the question of forfeitures. 3. That the sentence of acquittal in the district court was not conclusive upon the question of forfeiture; and, 4. That the defendants as officers of the customs, had a right to make the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Upon'the last' point, there does not seem to be rocm for doubt. At common law, any person . _ <em>J </em>may at his peril, seize fora forfeiture to the government; and if the government adopt his seizure, and the property is condemned, he will be completely justified;. and it is not necessary to sustain the Seizure, or justify the condemnation, that the party seizing shall be entitled to any - part of the forfeiture. <em>(Hale on the Customs. Harg. </em>Tracts, 227. Roe v. Roe, <em>Hardr. R. </em>185. Malden v. Bartlet, <em>Park. R. </em>105.; though Horne v. Boozey, 2 <em>Str. </em>952, seems contra.) And if the party be entitled to any part of the forfeiture, (as the informer under the statute of 1794', ch. 50. is by the express provision of the Law,) th\u00e9re can be no doubt, that he is entitled in that character to seize. (Roberts v. Witherhead, 12 <em>Mod. </em>92.) In the abs\u00e9nce of all positive &gt; authority, it might be proper to resort to these principles, in aid of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the manifest purposes of the law. But there are express statuteable \u25a0 provisions, which directly apply to the present case. The act of the 2d of March, 1799, ch. 128. s. 70. makes it the duty of the several officers of the customs, to make seizure of all ve.sseis and goods liable to seizure by virtue of any act <em>J J . </em>of the United. States, respecting the revenue, and . , , , <em>r </em>, assuming the statute of 1794, ch. 50. not to be a revenue law within the meaning of this clause, still the'pase falls within the broader language of the' act- of the 18th of February 1793, ch. 8. s. 27. which authorizes thp officers of the revenue to make seizure of any ship or goods, where any breach of the laws of the United States has been committed. Upon the general principle then, which has b\u00e9en, abov\u00e9 stated, and upon -the express enactment of the statute, the defendants, supposing thereto have been an actual, forfeiture, might justify'themselves in the seizure. There Is this strong additional reason in support of the sition, that the forf\u00e9iture' must be. deemed to attach at the moment-of the-commission'of the offence, and consequently, fronji that moment, the title of the plaintiff would he completely devested, so that he could maintain.no action for the subsequent seizure. This the doctfine of the English courts, and it has been recognised and enforced in this court, upon very solemn argument.. (U. S. v. 1960 Bags of Coffee, 8 <em>Cranc</em>h, 398. The Mars, 8 Cranch, 417. Roberts v. Witherhead, 12 <em>Mod. </em>92. Salk. 223. Wilkins v.

This is a question of vast practical importance ; but in our judgment, of no intrinsic legal difficulty. By the constitution, the judicial power of the Unite.d States extends to all cases of law and equity arising under the constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, and to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; and by the judiciary act' of 1789, ch. 2(X s. 9. the district courts are invested with easeful\u2022 <em>give </em>original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and of all seizures on land and water, and of all suits for penalties and forfeitures incurred under the laws of the United States. This is a seizure for a forfeiture under the laws of the United States, and, consequently, the right' to decide Upon the same, by the very term's of the- statutes, exclusively belongs to the proper court .of the United States; and it depends upon its.final decree,.proceeding m rem, whether the seizure is to' be adjudged rightful or tortious. If.a sentence of condemnation bq pronounced, it is conclusive, that a forfeiture is incurred ; if a sentence of. acquittal, it is equally conclusive against. the forfeiture ; and in either case, the question cannot be litigated in another forum. This was the doctrine asserted by this court, in the case of Slocum v. Mayberry, (2 <em>Wheat. R. </em>1.) after very, deliberate Consideration, and to that doctrine we unanimously adh\u00e9re.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The reasonableness 'of this doctrine results from the very nature of proceedings <em>in rem. </em>All persons haying an interest in the subject mfitter,.whether as seizing officers,, or informers, or claimants, are parties or may be parties to such suits, so far as their interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>extends. The decree of the court acts upon the thing \u2022iii controversy, and settles the title of the property it\" \u2022elf, the right of seizure, and the question &lt;of forfeiture. If its decree were not binding upon all the world upon the points which it professes to dqcide, the consequences would be most mischievous to the public. In case o\u00ed condemnation no good title to the property could be conveyed, and no justification of the seizure could be, asserted under its protection- In case of acquittal, a new seizure might be made by any other persons <em>toties quoties </em>for the same offence, and the claimant be loaded with ruinous costs and expenses. This reasoning applies to the decree of a court having competent jurisdiction of the cause, although it mav not be exclusive. But it applies with greater -force to tt court ot exclusive jurisdiction;, since an attempt to re-examing its decree, or deny its conclusiveness, is .a manliest violation of its exclusive authority. It is doing that indirectly,.which the law itself prohibits to be done directly. It is, in effect, impeaching collaterally, a sentence which the law \u00f1as pronounced to be valid until vacated or reversed on appeal by a superior tribunal.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"A0s\">An action fir the seizure cannot bo stategcourt of beforeTi^de\u201csi.on th# United States*1 <em>rm?e S </em>**</headnotes>\n<p id=\"Aza\">The argument against this doctrine, which has been . , urged at t\u00f1e bar, is, that an action of trespass will in c\u00e1se of a seizure, lie in a state court of common law, and therefore the defendant must have a right to protect himself by pleading the fact of forfeiture in his J , . defence. But at what.time and under what stances will an action -of trespass lie? If the action be commenced while the proceedings <em>in rem </em>for the supposed forfeiture are pending in the proper court of. the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>United States, it is commenced too soon; for until a final decree, it cannot be asc\u00e9rtained whether it be a trespass or not, since the decree can alone decide whether he taking be rightful dr tortious. The pendency of the suit <em>in rem </em>would be a good plea in abatement, or a temporary bar of the action, for it would establish that-good cause of action then existed, If the action be commenced after a decree of condemnation, or after-:an acquittal, and there be a certificate of reasonable cause . . seizure, then m the former case by the general law, and 111 the latter case by the special enactment of the statute of the 25th of April, 1810, ch. 64.

Despard, (6. T. R. <em>112.) </em>and Roberts v. Witherhead (12 <em>Mod. 92. Salk</em>. 323.) have been relied on to shd.w that a court of , , - common . law many entertain the question of lorfeiture&gt; notwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction 'of exchequer <em>in rem. </em>But these cases do not Sustain - the argument. They were both founded on the act of navigation; 12 Car. 2. Ch. 18. s. 1. which \u00a1among other things, enacts that one third of .the forfeiture shall go to him \u201cwho shall seize, inform, or sire for the same <em>in amj court \u00f3f record\u201d </em>So that at js apparent that in respect to forfeitures under this statute, the exchequer had not \u00aeji exclusive jurisdiction, 'but that; the other courts of common law had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>At least a concurrent jurisdiction! And if these cases clid not admit of this obvious distinction, certainly they could not be admitted to govern this court in ascertaining a jurisdiction. vested by the constitution and laws of the United States exclusively in .their oww courts.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"Asr\">The decision exclusive junsdietion, is completely the \"judgment ^[^vhe\u00bb \u00edh\u00ae *am\u00ae sub\" jedt matter comesIncidenverey.in oontr\u00b0</headnotes>\n<p id=\"AE9\">Tt is, therefore, clearly our opinion, that a state court .hhs no legal authority to entertain the quesfion of foffeiture in this cas,e; and that it.exclusively belonged to the cognizance of the proper court of the United States. Indeed no principie of general law seems better settled, than that the decision oi a court of a peculiar and exclusive jurisdiction must be completely hind- . . \u2022 .. mg upon, the judgment of every other court, m which the snrdie subject matter comes incidentally in controwersy. It is familiarly known in its application t\u00f3 the sentences Of ecclesiastical courts, in the probate of . drills and granting of administrations of.personal estate; te the sentences of prize courts in all matters of prize jurisdiction ; and to the sentences of eodrts of admiralty and other courts acting <em>in </em>rem, either to. enforce forfeitures or to decide civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">In the preceding discussion, we have been unavpidably led to consider and affirm the conclusiveness of the sentence of a court of competent jurisdiction proceeding <em>in rem </em>as to the question of forfeiture; and <em>a fortiori </em>to affirm it ili a case where there is an exclusive jurisdiction. In clases of condemnation the authorities are so distinct and pointed, that it would, after the Very: learned discussions in tha state courts, be a. vtaste of time to examine them at large. . Nothing caji be better settled, than that a sentence of condemna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>tion is, in an action of trespass for the . property ttite0, conclusive evidence against the title of the plaintiff, (See <em>Harg. </em>Tracts, 467. and cases there cited.

Runnington Eject. </em>364. <em>Hale. Hist. Common Law by Runnington, </em>note, p. 39. &amp;c.) Lord Chief Justice J)e Grey declare\u00bb' that' the rufo of evidence must1 be,r as it is often, declared t\u00f3 be, <em>reciprocal;, </em>and' that, in all cases.in which\u2022 the .sentences favourable to the party are to b\u00a7 admitted as conclusiyf? evidence for him. the sentences, if unfavourable, are, in like manner, conclusive evidence against him. .This is the' language of very, high authority, since it.is the united, opinion of all the judges of England ; apd though,.delivered, in .terms applicable strictly .to. a criminal suit, must-he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>doomed equally to apply to civil suits and sentences. And upon principle, where is there to be found a subsfaatial difference between a sentence of condemnstion and of acauittal <em>in rern </em>? If the former ascertains and fixes the forfeiture, and, therefore, it is conclusive, the latter no less ascertains that mere is no. forfeiture, and, therefore, restores the property to the claimant. It Cannot be pretended that a new seizure might, after an acquittal, be made tor the same sub-posed; offence;. or if made, mat the former sentence Would not,'as evidence, be conclusive, and, as a bar, be peremptory against the second suit <em>in rent. </em>And if conclusive either way, it must be because the acquittal ascertains the fact that there was no forfeiture. .And\u2019if the fact.be found, it is strange that it cannot be \u2022evidence for the party if found one way and yet can hbi evidence against him, if found another way. If such were the rule, it would be a perfect anomaly in the l\u00e1w, and utterly subversive of the first principles of re ciprocal justice. The only authority relied on for this purpose is a dictum in. <em>Butter's Nisi </em>Prius, (245.) where it is said that though a conviction in a court of \u2022criminal jurisdiction be conclusive evidence of the fact, ilit aCterwaids come collaterally in 'Controversy in a -coart of Civil, jurisdiction; yet an acquittal in such wxurt is no proof of .the reverse, for an acquittal ascertains ho fact as a conviction does. The case relied on to support this dictum, (3 <em>Mod. </em>164.) contains nothing which-lends any countenance to it. <em>(Peake's Evid. </em>3d ed. p. 47,48.) \"But assuming it to be good law in respect to criminal suits, it has nothing to do with pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ceedings <em>in rem. </em>Where property is seized and libelled as forfeited to-the government, the sole object of the suit is to ascertain whether the seizure be.rightful, and the forfeiture incurred or not. The decree \u25a0 of the court, in such case,\"acts upon the thing itself, and binds the interests of all the world, whether any party actually appears or not. If it is condemned, the. title of the property is completely .changed, and the new- title acquired by the forfeiture travels with the thing in all its future progress.' If, on the other hand, it is acquitted, the taint of forfeiture is completely removed;, and cannot be re-annexed to it. The original owner stands upon his title -discharged of any latent claims, with which the supposed forfeiture may have previously infected it. A sentence of acquittal <em>in rem </em>does, therefore, ascertain a fact, as much as a sentence of condemnation ; it ascertains and fixes the fact that the property is not liable to the asserted claim of forfeit\" ure. It should therefore d&gt;e conclusive upon, all the \u2022 world of the non-existence of the title of forfeiture, for the same reason that a sentence of condemnation is conclusive of the existence of the title of forfeiture. It' would be strange indeed, if, when the forfeiture ex <em>directo </em>could not be enforced against the thing, but by an. acquittal, was completely purged away, that indirect\u00bb, ly. the forfeiture might be enforced through the seizing officer; and that he should be at liberty to asseit a twtie for the government, which is judicially abandoned by,.or conclusively established against, the government itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>One argument farther has been, urged at the bar on this point, which deserves notice. It is, that the sentence of acquittal, ought not to be conclusive upon the -^original defendants, because, they were not parties to ' that suit. This argument addresses'itself equally to a seatehc\u00e9 of condemnation and yet in such case .this sentence would have been conclusive evidence in fa-r voiir of the defendants. The reason, however, of this ruleis.to be found in the nature of proceedings <em>in rem. </em>To.such proceedings all persons having an - interest 'pi title in the subject matter are, as we have already star ted, m law, deemed parties; -and the decree of the court is conclusive upon all'interests and titles in controversy before it. The title of forfeiture is - necessary ly in controversy in a suit to establish that forfeiture ; and therefore all persons having a right or interest ,in establishing it (as'the seizing officer has.) are, inlegq]! contemplation, parties to the suit. It is a great mis? t\u00e1kie to consider the seizing officer as a mere stranger to the suit. He virtually identifies himself- with the government itself, whose asrent he is, from the \u00edpoment of the seizure-up to the termination.of the suit, His own will is bound up -in the acts of the government in reference to.the suit: For some purposes, as. for ipstan.ee to procure a decree of distribution after condemnation, where he is entitled to share in the forfeiture, or to \u00f3btain .a. certificate of reasonable \u2022 caus\u00e9 of seizure after an acquittal, he may ihake himself a direct' party to .-the suit, and in. all other cases hie. is deemed to be \u25a0 present and represented by the government itself, \u00bfBy the very, act of seizure he agrees to. become a, party \u2020\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the suit under the <em>government; for </em>in no other H&amp;ttner can he show an authority to make thp seizure, or to enforce the forfeiture. If the government ret fuse to adopt his acts or waive the forfeiture; there is an end to his claim: he cannot proceed to enforce that which the government repudiates. In legal propriety, therefore, he cannot be deemed a stranger the decree <em>in rem; </em>he is at all events a privy, and'an such must be bound by a sentence which ascertains the seizure to be tortious. But if he were a mere stranger; he would still be bound by such sentence^ because the decree of a court of competent jurisdiction <em>in rem </em>is, as to the points directly in judgment, concht- . sive upon the whole world.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\">Upon principle, therefore, we are of opinion that the sentence of acquittal in this case, with a denial <em>of </em>a certificate of reasonable cause of seizure, was conclusive evidence that no forfeiture was, incurred; and that the seizure was tortious : and that these questions cannot again be litigated in any other forum. And if the point had never been decided, we should from- its reasonableness and known analogy to other proceed^ ingS} have had entire confidence in the correctness of the doctrine. But there are authorities directly \u00a1hit point which have never been overruled, potas far \u201eas we know ever been brought judicially \u00abinto doubt. Above a century ago it was decided by Mr. Baron Price, <em>(12 Vin.- Miridgmitotj </em>A B, 22. p. 95.) that an acquittal ,in the 'exfchequer was conclusive evidence of the illUgi&amp;ty Of the feeizur\u00e9, and he refused in th\u00e1t case (whifch was trover <em>fot </em>the goods seized) to let the parties in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>to. contest the fact over again. This case was cited as undoubted law by Mr. Justice Blackstone, in his elaborate opinion, in Scott v. Shearman, (2 <em>W. Bl. </em>977.;) and the doctrine was fully recognized by the court, and particularly fay Lord Kenyon, in Cooke v. Sholl, (5 <em>T. </em>R. 255.) although that cause finally went off uponi another point. . In all the cases which have been decided on this subject, no -distinction has ever been tajeen between a condemnation and an acquittal <em>in rem, </em>and the manner in which these cases have been cited by bhe court, obviously show that no such distinction was. ever in their contemplation. \u2022 If to these decisions we add the pointed language of Lord Chief Justice De Grey, (in the Dutchess of Kingston\u2019s case, 11 <em>State </em>Trials, 218. &amp;c.) \u201ctnat the rule of evidence must be, as it is often declared tobe reciprocalthe declaration of Lord Kenyon, in Geyer v. Aguilar, 7 <em>T. R. </em>681. 996.) that *\u2018where there has been a proceeding in the exchequer, and a judgment <em>in rem$ </em>as long as that judgment remains in force it is obligatory upon the parties who have civil rights depending on the same question;\u201d and the generul rule laid down by Lord Apsley, (Meadows v. Dutchess of Kingston, <em>Amb. Rep. </em>756.) that where a matter comes to be tried in <em>\u201ca </em>collateral way, the decree of a court having competent jurisdiction shall be received as concl\u00fasive evidence of the m\u00e1tter,\u201d <em>ex dirbeto </em>determined; there seems a weight of authority in favour of the doctrine, which it is very-difficult to resist. We may add, that in a recent case whick was not cited at the argument, (The Bennet, 1 <em>Dodson\u2019s Rep. </em>175. 180.) where a.ship had been.captur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>e&lt;3 as a prize, as being engaged in an illegal voyage an&lt;^ actlu^ed ^y tbe .sentence of a vice-admiralty court, Sir. W. Scott held, that by such sentence .of a-competent tribunal, the question had become <em>res adjud\u00edcala, </em>and might be opposed with success as a bar to any inquiry into the same facts upon a second capture during the. same voyage. Yet here the parties, who -were, captors, were different; and the argument might have been urged, that the acquittal ascertained no fact. The learned judge, however, considered the acquittal conclusive proof against the illegality of the voyage, and that all the world were bound by the sentence of. acquittal <em>in rem. </em>And the sanie doctrine was held by Mr. Justice Buller, in his very learned opinion in Le Caux v. Eden, <em>(Doug. Rep. </em>594. 611, 612.) <footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>This view of the case would be conclusive agaipst the admission of the evidence offered by the original defendants at the trial, as a justification of the as-\u2022 serted trespass. But the other point which has been stated, and which involves the.-construction of the act of 1794, ch. 50. s. 3, is not less decisive against the defendants. That act indicts a forfeiture of the ship, \u00e1te., in cases where she is fitted out and armed, or attempted or procured t\u00f3 be fitted out and armed, with the intent to be employed \u201c.in the service of <em>any foreign prince or </em>state, to cruise or commit hostilities upon the subjects, citizens or property of <em>another foreign prince or state </em>with whom the United . States are at peace.\u201d The evidence offered . and rejected, was to pro ve that the ship was attempted to be fitted out and armed, and was fitted out and armed, with intent that she should be employed in the ser-' vice of that part of the island of St. Domingo which was then under the government of Pelion, to cruise and coanmit hostilities upon the subjects, citizens, and. property of that part of the Island of St, Domingo which was then under the government of Christophe. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>No evidence was offered to prove, that either of these governments was recognised by the government \u00f3f the United States, or of France, \u201c as a foreign prince or stateand if the court was bound to admit the evidence, as it. stood, without this additional proof, it must, have been upon the ground that it was bound to take judicial notice of the relations of the country withJ foreign states, and to decide affirmatively, that Petion and Christophe were foreign princes within tjjg purview of the statute. No doct ne is better r ... . established, than that it belongs-exclusively to go- \u201e , . ,, \u00b6 to recognise new states m the revolutions which, may' occur in the world; and until such i\u00abcognition, either by our own government, or. the go vernment to which the new state belonged, court* . _ . - . of justice \u2018are bound to consider the ancient state of things as remaining unaltered. This v\u00edas ex. pr ss2y by this court in the case of Rose <em>v. </em>Himely, (4 Cranch, 241.) and to that decision on , . , , , . . \u2022 this' point we .adhere. And the. same doctrine is clearly sustained, by the judgment of foreign tribuna\u00a1g&gt; (The Manilla, 1 <em>Edwards </em>R. 1. The city of Berne v. The Bank of England, 9 <em>Ves. 347. </em>Dolden v. Bank of England, 10 <em>Ves. </em>353. 11 283.)

The evidence has no legal tendency to show that any forfeiture had been incurred, and upon the. proof, already) in the caus\u00e9, the seizure was established to be tortious; The plaintiff admitted that the defendants had acted without malice, or an intention of oppression.. Under such circumstances, he waived any claim for rindiCr tive damages, and the state court very properly:direcce\u00e1 the jury, that the plaintiff could only recover the actual damages sustained by him; And in rio pOssihld shape, consistently1 with the rules of law, could the-cvidence diminish the right of the plaintiff to recover his actual damages. We have taken notice of this point the more, readily, because, it was pressed at the bar with considerable . earnestness. Hut in strictness of laV) the point is not subject to our revision. We have n\u00a9 right j on a writ of \u00e9rror from a. state court, under the act of congress, to inquire into the legal correctness 6f the rule by which the damages were ascertained and assessed. There'is ho law of the United States, which interferes withj or touches, the question of damages; It is a question depending altogether upon the common lawi and the act of congress . has expressly preciu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tied us frrtm a consideration qf such a question. Wheth* .er such a restriction can be defended upon public policy, or principle, may well admit of most serious doubts.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">We may now pass to the consideration' of the second plea, which asserts, as a defence,a seizure under the laws of the United States, by the express instruction of the president,' for a supposed forfeiture <em>in rem, </em>. and attempts to put in issue the question \u2022 whether such forfeiture was incurred or not. If this plea- was well pleaded, then a question may properly be said to arise within the meaning of the 25th section of the judiciary act, and as the state court decided against the right and authority setup thereon,, the decision is re-examinable in this court. Several objections have been urged at the bar against the sufficiency of this plea upon technical grounds ; and if these objections are well founded, then it may be admitted that the court below may have given judgment on these special grounds, and not have, decided against the right and authority set up under the United States.. In the first place, it is argued, that this plea 'is bad, because'it does not answer the whole charge in the declaration,-the plea justifying only the taking and detention, and containing no answer to the damaging, spoiling, and conversion of thq property -charged in the declaration. We are, however, of opinion, that the'plaintiff can take nothing by this- . objection. The gist of the action in. this case was the taking and detention,, and the damaging, spoiling, and conversion were matter of aggravation only; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>and it is perfectly well settled, that a plea need answer only the gist of the action, and if the matter alleged in aggravation be relied on as \u25a0 a substantive trespass, it should be replied by way of new assignment. (Taylor v. Cole, 3 <em>T. R. </em>292. S. C. <em>H. Bl. </em>555. Dye v. Leatherdale, 3 <em>Wils. R. </em>20. Fisherwood v. Carman, cited 3 <em>T. R. </em>297. Gates v. Bayley, 2 <em>Wils. R. </em>313. <em>1 Saund. R. </em>28. note 3. <em>Cam. Dig. Plead, </em>E. 1. Monprivatt v. Smith, 2 <em>Camp. R. </em>175.) Independent, however, of this general ground, there is, in this particular, case, a decisive answer to the objection; for if the matter of the plea were true and well pleaded, then by the forfeiture the property was completely divested out of .the plaintiff; and, consequently, neither the conversion nor damage were any injury to him.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"Ajc\">t^e'gist of the action, and if the matter al aggra x\u00a1ed <em>va </em>as a A plea need it, \u25a0 of new assign</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"AZy\">p^^na^h*8</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">But there are other defects in this plea which, in our judgment, are fatal. In the first place it is not alleged that the'ship and her equipments were forfeited for any offence under the laws of th\u00e9 United States. It is true that it is stated, that the ship was attempted to he fitted out and armed,'with intent that she should be employed in the service of a foreign state, <em>See. </em>to commit'hostilities-upon the subjects \u00f3f another foreign state, &amp;c. contrary to the statute in' such case made and provided. But it is not added, whereby and for the cause aforesaid she became .and was.^forfeited to the United States.. Nor is this-deficiency supplied by the subsequent averment, that the ship was, by the instructions of. the president, seized \u201cas forfeited t'o th\u00e9 use of the United States;\u201d for Ihe manner and\u2019cayse of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>forfeiture* ought to be directly stated. The plea is, therefore, not only argumentative, but it omits a substantive allegation, without which it could not be sustained as a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"APO\">In the next place, the plea is bad, because it does pot aver that the governments of PetioP and Christoph? are foreign states which have been duly recognised, \u00e1s such, by the government of the United States, or of France, which, for reasons already stated, was tfpcesspry to complete the legal sufficien\u00f3y of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">And in our judgment a still more decisive objection is, that the plea attempts to draw to the cognisance of a state court a question of forfeiture under the laws oy the United States, of which the federal courts have, by the constitution and laws of the United States, an exclusive jurisdiction. For the reasons already mentioned, if the suit for the forfeiture was .still pending wh'\u00e9t\u00ed the action was brought, that fact ought to have beep pleaded in abatement, or a temporary bar to such action: If the action was brought before.proceedi\u00f1gs <em>inrem </em>had. been instituted,' that fact' ought to have been pleaded, with an allegation that the jurisdiction of the question \u25a0 of forfeiture exclusively belonged to the district court of the district where the seizure was . made, which would have' been a plea in the nature of a plea to the jurisdiction of the state court: If the suit were.determined, then a condemnation, or an acquittal with a certificate of,reasonable cause of seizure, .ought to have been pleaded, as a general bar to the action. These are all the legal defences \u2018which the mere seizure could justify; and if these all failed, then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>seizing officer must have been deemed gui, -y of the trespass. The plea then stops short of the allegations .which the seizing officer. was bound to make to sustain his defence, and it attempts to put in issue matter which, standing alone, no court of common law is competent to try. The demurrer then may well be sustained to this' plea, since the party demurring admits nothing except what'is well pleaded, and the plea being had in substance, there is, in point pf lajvs no confession of any forfeiture.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AbXq\">under the act of 1794, ch. so. state the part\u00edcula prince or state theshipwM*. sruwe,.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"An7\">The third plea differs iri several respects from the second, and is that on which the couit have felt their principal difficulty. It asserts that the ship was attempted to be fitted out and armed, with intent that she should be employed in the service of some foreign state, to commit hostilities upon the subjects of -another foreign state with which the United States were then at peace, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided j and that the defendants by virtue of the instructions of, the president, \u201cdid take possession of, and detain,\u201dthe said ship, &amp;c, \u201cin order to the execution of the prohibitions and penalties of the act in such case made and provided.\u201d It omits to allege any forfeiture of the ship, or that she was seized as forfeited. So far then as the plea may be supposed to rely on such forfeiture as a justification, it is. open to the same objections which have been stated against vocond nlesi secona piea.</p>\n<p id=\"AgG\">Another objection has been urged\u2019at the bar . i , . , , , , , ^ this plea, which does not apply to the second; It is, that it does not specify the foreign state in whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>vice, or against whom, the ship was intended to be cmployed. As the allegation follows the words- of the statute, it has sufficient certainty fora libel or information <em>in rem </em>for the asserted forfeiture under the statute? and, consequently, it has sufficient certainty for a plea. Indeed, there is as much certainty as there would have been, if it had been averred that it was in the service of er against, some foreign state unknown to the libellant,which has been adjudged in this court, to be sufficient, in an information of forfeiture. (Locke v. The United States, <em>7 Cranch, </em>339.</p>\n<p id=\"A0M\">But the main objection to this plea js that it ' attempts. to justify the taking possession, and detaining of the ship, under the- instructions of the president, when the facts stated in the plea do not bring the case within- the purview of- the statute of 1794, ch 50 which is relied on for this purpose. This statute, in the Seventh section, provides, that in every case in Which \u00e1 vessel shall be fitted out and armed, or attempted to be fitted out- and armed, or in which the force of any vessel of war,, cruiser, or other armed Vessel, shall be increased or augmented, or in which any military expedition or enterprise shall be b\u00e9gun, Or set on foot, contrary to the prohibitions and provisions of that act, and in'every case of the capture of a ship or vessel within the jurisdiction or protection of the-United States, and in every case in which any process issuing out of any court of the United State's shall be disobeyed or resisted by any person or persbns, having the custody of any vessel of war, cruiser-, ar other, armed vessel of any foreign prince or state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>or of the subjects or citizens of any such-orince or state; <em>in every sucji </em>case, it shall be lawful for the president of the United Slates, or such other person as he shall have empowered for that purpose <em>to employ </em>such part of the land or navel forces of the United States, or of the malitia thereof, as shall be judged necessary for the purpose <em>of'taking possession of and detaining </em>any such ship or v\u00e9ssel, with her prize or prizes if any, in order to the execution of the prohibitions and penalties of the act, &amp;c. It is to be recollected that this third plea does not- allege any forfeiture, or justify the taking and detaining of the ship for any forfeiture; and that it does not allege that the president did employ any ~part of the land or. navel forces, or militia of the United States for this purpose, or that the original defendants, or either of them, belonged to the navel or military forces of the United States, or were employed in any such capacity, to take and detain the ship, in order to the execution of the prohibitions and penalties of the act. But the argument is, that as the president. had authority by the act to employ the navel and military forces of the United States for- this purpose, <em>a .fortiori) </em>he might do. it by the employment ofcivil force. But'upon the most deliberate consideration, we are of a different opinion. The power Hips entrusted to the . . , . \u2018 V , , , .. . / . president is of-a very high and delicate nature, and if\u00e9stly intended to be-exercised only when, by the qrdinary process or exercise of civil authority, the.pur.por ses of the law cannot- be effectuated. It is .to be erted On extraordinary occasions, and subject, to that high responsibility which all executive acts necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Involve. Whenever it is exerted, all-persons Who afef in Obedience to the executive: instructions, ill cases-within the act, are completely justified in taking pbS* session of,..and detaining the offending vessel, and'arfe not responsible in damages for any injury Which the .party may Suffer by reason of such proceeding! Stifely it never could have been the. intention 0-f congress, 'that such a power should be allowed as a shield to thfe seizing officer, in cases where that seizure might be made by the ordinary civil means? One Of the cases put in the section is, Where any process Of the courts of the United States is disobeyed - and resisted; and this case.abundantly.shows, that the' authority of thfe president was riot, intended to be called into exercise, unless where military and naval force were necessary to ensure the execution of the laws. In terms thfe section is confined to, -the employment of military and naval forces; and there is neither <em>public policy </em>ndi princip\u00ede lo justify \u00e1n extension of the prerogative, beyond the terms in which it is given. Congress might he perfectly willing to entrust the president With the power to take and detain, whenever, in his opinion, the case was. So-fiagratit that military or haval force was necessary to enforce the law\u00e1, and yet yritli great propriety deny it, where, From circumstances of the case, the civil '' officers of the g\u00f3^Verntnent might, upon their private responsibility, .without any danger to the public peace, completely execute them. It is certainly against the general theory of our institutions to\u2019 create great - discretionary powers by\u2019 implication; and in the preseiit ill-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>stance we see nothing to justify it. The Ihird plea is, therefore, for this' additional reasbn, bad in its Very siibs'tance, and the state court were right in giving judgment on the demurrer for the Original plaintiff.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"Adn\">The 7th sec on794,yh.so! except tocase\u00bb where a rei or. deten b^nforMd'by h wasne cessnry m the president\u2019s o ploy \"na-ral'or raiktary jxrtf er.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The judgment of the court.for the correction of errors of the state of New-York, is affirmed with damages at the rate of 6 per cent, upon the judgment, from the rendition thereof, and costs\u00bb</p>\n<author id=\"b341-4\">Mr. Justice Johnson.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax-\">As the opinion delivered ift this case goes into the consideration of a variety of topics which do not appear to me to be essential to the Case, I will present a brief view of all that I consider as now decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Three pleas are filed to the .action.

And on this point this court is of opinion that the state court decided correctly. This court is also of opi- . <em>J </em>. . 1, mon, that the state court could not have tried the of forfeiture arising under the laws of the States. But this point would have been fatal suit, n\u00b0t to the defence, had it been properly pleaded.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"Ae36\">Acquittnl in the district court Se*ques\u00b0tionoft0 forfeiture.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"Are\">Defect of the contafnnig;8</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"A1LE\">The seventh section of the act of 1794 did not authorize orfer^private sebse'but'on\u00edy rnilitary\u00b0^Qnd naval force to sureT* * 861</headnotes>\n<p id=\"A9Q\">To the second and third pleas the defendant ciemurbut as the second plea contained only an argu- and, of course, defective averment of the forfeiture, viz. <em>u </em>seized as forfeited,\u201d that is <em>u </em>because forfeited,\u201d that plea did not bring up the question of forfeiture,.or any.question connected with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Neither does the third plea bring up the question of forfeiture : for the justification therein relied on is wholly \u2022 independent of the forfeiture, and rests upon order of the president to detain for trial, in effect. <em>\\ </em>. . Aftd hence the only other point in the case is, whether the seventh section of the act empowered the president to issue such an order. And on-this point we are \u00b0P^n^on&gt; that there is no power given by that act .to authorize a seizure, but only to call on the.military or naval forces to enforce a seizure when-nece\u2019ssary.

A vessel,- documented as Russian, is placed under the ^solute controul of a British house, is dispatched under the orders of that house to the Havanna, where \u25a0she is loaded under the directions of an individual of the name of Muhlenbruck, who assumes the character of agent of the Russian owners ; she is then ostensibly cleared out for Riga, but with express orders \u2019to call at a British port, and terminate her voyage under the orders of the same house, under the auspices of which .the adventure .had originated and been so far conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"A08\">Under these circumstances, it was certainly incumbent upon the claimant to show the previous correspondence of the British with the Russian house, and -th\u00e9 immediate dependence of the agent at the Havanna, upon the Russian house for authority, instructions, and resources. When we come to compare the correspondence of Muhlenbruck with that of Smith, the agent in the St. Nicholas; we find here, also, a striking similitude. In that case, the supposed correspondence with the Russian principal is inclosed under cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to. the British ho us\u00e9, with a request that they .\u00a1would forward it. In. this case'the letters covering, the invoice and bill of lading, and directed .to M. &amp; J. Krause, is confided to the captain, but with express instructions to forward it to the British house, and await itheir orders.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"ABG\">nEfnUg?romnthB</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"AaK\">dence of the claima,,t\u00bb and\u201e existence of evidence b of rest?y*lint*'</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The material facts on which the court relies, in making up its judgment on the claim of the cargo, are the following:.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In the first place, there is a general shade of suspicion cast over the whole case, by the fact that all material papers relating to the transaction were mysteriously concealed in a billet of wood. Had there been nothing fraudulent intended, these papers ought to have been delivered along with the documentary evidence. But they were not discovered until betrayed by one of the crew. It is upon the investigation of these papers, principally, that, the circumstances occur which discover the true character of- this voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Secondly. There is no evidence tha\u00ed this adventure was ever undertaken under instructions, from M. &amp; J. Krause. But there is evidence - that every , ; . <em>in </em>- thing is set m motion at the touch of Bennet &amp; Co. of London. And although they affect to act in the capacity of agents of the Russian house, even the 1 rules of the common law would constitute them principals, in a case in which they cannot exhibit the authority under which they assume the character' of agents. Again; there is no evidence that' any funds were furnished, by the Russian house for the purchase of this cargo. But there is evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>we think conclusive evidence, to \u2018show that it was purchased on - funds of the British house, remitted through the medium of the cargo of the Robert Bruce,, a ship loaded by Bennet' &amp; Cot, and despatched about'the same time for the Havanna. in tne letter of instructions of the 18th of March, 1813,<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>captqin is told to proceed to the Havanna and await the arrival of Muhlenbruck, in the Robert Bruce, for ordej^},-arid in ease of any accidents befalling that vessel..'-to apply to the Spanish house of Ychazo &amp; Carricabura,. at. the Havanna, for farther instructions. And in\" a letter to the house of Lorent Steinwitz of Charleston, Bennet &amp; Co. inform them, that the Fortuna is despatched to the Havanna to the address of Ychazo - and Carricabura to obtain a freight for the Baltic, and request Lorent &amp; Steinwitz to advise that house, if they could obtain a freight for her to any port in Europe., This correspondence is explained thus: the cargo of the' Robert Bruce would probably be sufficient to load this ship with colonial produce.; if she arrives in. safety, the original adventure can then proceed, but should she be captured or lost, some return freight must then be fc und for the Fortuna. And accordingly we find in the letter to Bennet &amp; Co. of the 24th March,<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> Mphlenbruck soli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>cits a credit on Jamaica or Cadiz as he expresses <em>if? te </em>to be able .to settle the surplus of the amount <em>al~veady shipped </em>which may be left out,of the proceeds'of the outward bound shipment <em>of </em>the Robert Bruce.\u201d' Now the. only shipment he had then made was by the Fortuna; and this letter gives advice of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>s&amp;ipment, as also of the arrival of the Robert Brace, and the progress he had made in disposing of her cargo. The passage quoted means, therefore, (although somewhat obscurely expressed,} \u201cIt is possible that the outward cargo of the Robert Bruce may not be sufficient to .pay for the shipment already made by the Fortuna, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>and you must, therefore, furnish me with a ciedit to make \u00fap .the deficiency,\u201d Ychazo and Carricabura no doubt advanced for the purchase of the cargo of sugars upon the credit of the cargo of the Robert Bruce, and according <em>y </em>we find that house charging a commission for advancing. On these facts we are satisfied that the cargo was purchased with British funds.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"A31\">Want of MuMenbraolf was the agent of the ciQimants, and proofs that he o?th^enemy house.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b252-3\">Lastly; there is no evidence that Muhlenhruck was agsnt of M.-&amp; \u00abL Krause, and there is abundant evidence of his being the avowed and confidential agent 0f tha British house. \"We see in the midst. of the anxiety to keep up the character of agent to the Russian house, this g'entleman,' without being awarG \u00b0f it, does an act which at once shows to whom he holds himself accountable. In his letter to Bennett &amp; Co. of flie &amp;4th of March, he requests them to inform the Russian house, that he has made certain advances on account of the ship; But why request Bennett &amp; Co. to do this,- if he was himself in immediate connection apd correspondence with the Russian house ? The tact is, his correspondence with the Russian house'was fictitious, and his object was to inform Bennett and\u2019 Co. in reality, whilst he feigned to address himself ip M. &amp; J. Kr\u00e1use, and thus the letters to the latter house, covering the invoice and bill of lading, although of the same date with that to Bennett &amp;' Co. omits this piece \u25a0of information,'which, in a real correspondence, would be groundwork of a credit to himself, and contains \u25a0nothing but the most general information, just enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>in fact to glps\u00bb over the transaction, and give it the aspect of reality.\"<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<headnotes id=\"Aqi8\">Neutral ship \u00bf\u00a3 \u2122r \u201ch(fr^!g subjects tl ship to ooi demnation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"AHG\">Relaxation cou\u2122'in a\u00ed\u00edc p^oofhfa'caBe\u2019 of concealment</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">With regard to the vessel, it would be enough to observe, that. if a neutral ship-owner will lend his name to cover a fraud with regard to the cargo, this circumstance alone will subject him to condemntioh. But'in this case -there are, also, many circumstances to , _ . . , maintain a supicion that the vessel was British property, or at least not owned as claimed. Although this court, from extreme anxiety to avoid subjecting a neutral to condemnation-, has relaxed its rules in allowing time for. further proof in a case where there was concealment-of papers,,yet nothing has been brought forwaid to support the neutral character of the ship. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>charter-party, no original correspondence, nothing, in fact, ..but those formal papers which never fail to accompany a fictitious,, as well as a real, transaction. On the contrary, we find the captain, without any instructions from his supposed owners, submitting implicitly to the orders of Bennett &amp; Co. in every thing ; and the latter assuming even a control over the contraCt which he exhibits with h;. supposed owner in Riga, and expressing a solicitude about his expenses, which could only have been suggested by a consciousness that the house of B. &amp; Co. would have- to pay those expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Upon the whole,'we are satisfied that it is a case for condemnation both of ship and cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\"><em> Translation of Exhibit, </em>287.

I hope that the above letter has reached you in time to grant, me as soon as possible the favour, and, beg to be convinced .that only the greatest necessity engages me to request it; not being able to draw on either America or England. I have now the greatest pleasure <em>to inform </em>you \u00bbof the safe arrival of the Robert Bruce, James Chessel, master, on the- \u00cd9th, under protection of his majesty\u2019s ship North Star, Captain Thomas Coe, from Jamaica. From Cork she sailed with' convoy, consisting of his majesty\u2019s ship Leviathan 74, Captain Adam Drummond, the Talbot 20, Captain Spelman Swaine, and the \u25a0 Scorpion . of. 18 guns, Therefore, she -has been the whole voyage under convoy, and the- insurers have to -pay the full returns of 6 per cent, The North Star, which sails to morrow, takes, all the ready vessels for Europe out to Berrhuda ; from thence another con.Voy'WjB bagranted to protect them to England, or at' least as far as the latitude oF Halifax. \u25a0 The Russian ship Fortuna, Captain Behrens, In-den with 1520 boxes assorted sugars bound t\u00f3 Riga, and for account and risk of Messrs, M. &amp;J. Krause at,that place is ready to jojn this convoy, \u2022 I enclose you invoice and bill of lading, which you.wili be pleased to forward, with the first opportunity to the above friends. The Captain Behrens has got instructions from me to touch, according .to the prevailing winds, either in Leith or in the channel. By the present circumstances on. the continent1of Europe, Messrs, M. &amp; J. \u00bfpause may have been induced- to send this car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>go to a better market than it , probably meets at Riga. Should they have given you any instructions concerning this vessel, the Gaptain Behrens has .orders to wait, for your kind information in regard of the farther destination, which ordersfrom you I beg to send him as soon as you know- at what port of the above mentioned he has arrived in England. Please to inform also Messrs. M. &amp; J. Krause, that, I -have -advanced here the captain, 1332 dollars 4 cents, for the use of ship Fortuna. Next week- the cargo of the Robert Bruce will be all delivered, and I endeavour to procure - the highest prices possible, The Oznaburgs will sell as well as the Estopillas,'but I am sorry you was not able to get more of the latter, and of a finer quality, being always the leading article of an assortment of linen. The pri\u00abca of sugar are nearly the same, and the arrival of this convoy has brought them \u00fap 1-8 to 1-4 dollar higher. Coffee is lower, and I expect to buy and lay in good coffee, at 10 toll dollars. Messrs, Hubbeits, Taylor &amp;' Simpson inform me that I may not expect a convoy leaving Jamaica before the 20th of April. This same convoy can arrive here the 10th or 15th of May, and sill possible exerticm shall be made on my side to get the Robert Bruco laden before this time. I have \u2022 till now not received an answer of Messrs. Hibberts, respecting the bills on London.- Your kind letter1 of the 18th of December I have duly received.
